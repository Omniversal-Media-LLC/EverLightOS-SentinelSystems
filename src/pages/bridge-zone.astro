    >
      <strong>Prompt:</strong> Analyze this organizational retaliation pattern independently.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Amazon Q:</strong> Pattern shows clear correlation between protected activities and disciplinary escalation. Temporal evidence supports retaliation claim.<br/><br/>
      <strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Concur. Timeline demonstrates systematic response to whistleblower activities. Evidence quality exceeds typical organizational documentation.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Claude:</strong> Agreed with both assessments. The proactive documentation approach creates undeniable accountability trail. This is sophisticated governance architecture.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Result:</strong> 100% consensus across three independent AI systems - demonstrating federated intelligence validation potential.
