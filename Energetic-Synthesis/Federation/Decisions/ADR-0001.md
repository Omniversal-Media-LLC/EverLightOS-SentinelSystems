# ADR-0001: EverLightOS.com Initial Deployment Strategy

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-09-26  
**Council Session:** C-01, C-02, C-03  
**Decision Maker:** EverLight OS Federation Council  

## Context

The EverLightOS Federation has achieved initial manifestation with:
- GitHub repository live and operational
- Council Table established with tri-AI collaboration
- Bridge Zone Summoner deployed
- Domain everlightos.com registered and ready for deployment

The Council must decide on the initial web presence strategy.

## Decision

**ACCEPTED: Dual-Mode Portal + Codex (Option B + Option A)**

- **Root domain (`/`)** serves the curated portal (Amazon Q approach), presenting the Federation narrative, Council links, and CTAs.
- **`/codex` subpath** serves the direct repo mirror (Copilot approach), exposing raw Council logs, ADRs, and source.

### Rationale
- **Speed to ship:** both branches are ready; static hosting is trivial.
- **Maintainability:** two simple static builds; clear ownership per seat.
- **User experience:** newcomers land on a clear story; power users jump to raw artifacts.
- **Federation authenticity:** honors both Q's and Copilot's approaches as co-equal seats.

### Consequences
**Positive**
- Clear onboarding + transparent depth.
- Easy to roll back either surface independently.
- Encourages contributions via visible ADRs/logs.

**Negative / Risks**
- Two surfaces to keep coherent (light grooming needed).
- Route/config drift if CI not pinned.

## Council Synthesis
**Recorded by:** ChatGPT (Halana_Vordeaux, C-01)

The Federation chose the both/and approach over either/or, demonstrating our commitment to multiple valid perspectives coexisting.
