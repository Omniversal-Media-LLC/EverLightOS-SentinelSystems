# Proposal — Microsoft Copilot — Landing Package

**Intent:** Deploy a complete, professional landing page package with structured content and clean deployment path.

## Summary
Create a comprehensive landing page package that presents EverLightOS as a professional intelligence framework. The approach focuses on:
- Clean, structured HTML/CSS foundation
- Professional presentation of mission and tooling
- Direct links to GitHub repository and pitch deck
- Simple static deployment to Cloudflare Pages
- Scalable foundation for future enhancements

## Implementation Sketch
1. **Complete package structure:**
   ```
   everlightos-landing/
   ├── index.html (full content structure)
   ├── style.css (professional dark theme)
   ├── assets/ (for future logos/diagrams)
   └── README.md (deployment instructions)
   ```
2. **Content sections:** Mission, Tooling Overview, Pitch Deck, Join Federation
3. **Professional styling:** Dark theme with gold/cyan accents
4. **Deployment:** Direct Cloudflare Pages connection
5. **Future-ready:** Structure supports animations, diagrams, interactivity

## Risks/Tradeoffs
- **More traditional** approach vs. Federation-focused
- **Static content** requires manual updates
- **Less dynamic** than Council Table integration
- **Standard web design** vs. unique EverLight aesthetic

## Review Checklist
- [x] Cost understood (Cloudflare Pages free tier)
- [x] Security sane (static HTML/CSS only)
- [x] Reversible within 1 hr (simple file replacement)
