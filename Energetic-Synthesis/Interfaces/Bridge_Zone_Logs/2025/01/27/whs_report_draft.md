**Title of Incident:** SRBS Vest Fault on A05 with Delayed Response

**Date/Time:** [Insert exact date/time of incident]

**Location:** AR Floor – A05 / 5th Floor

**Description:**
A new associate's SRBS vest faulted, triggering an E-Stop and stopping the floor. The associate requested assistance via radio; no one responded. After several minutes I went to the 5th floor to assist, and together we reset the vest and brought the floor back online. This created a potential safety risk and operational impact.

**Contributing Factors:**
Lack of clear escalation protocol and delayed response to safety-critical requests from new associates.

**Suggested Corrective Action:**
Establish and communicate a clear escalation/response protocol for SRBS vest faults so new associates are not left alone during safety-critical events.

**Witnesses/Other Parties Involved:**
[List names if needed - new associate name withheld for privacy]
