  "text": "The Stellar Bridge dimensional Universe, and is thus considered the Meta-Galactic Core.) The D-9 Galactic Core is located, in spatial terms, within the Andromeda Star System. Part of Andromeda is located within D-10 frequency bands and is connected to the D-10 Lyra Star system (Lyra extends from D-10 through D- 12) and part of Andromeda is located within D-9 frequency bands. The Merkaba Field spirals of the Andromeda system are composed of D-9 and D-10 frequency bands and when this D-9/D-10 Merkaba Field interfaces with the D-1/D-2/D-3 Merkaba Fields of Earth, D-9/D-10 frequencies trans- mit into Earth\u2019s core and run through Earth\u2019s grid. The D-9/D-10 Merkaba Fields cannot directly interface with the lower-dimensional Merkaba Fields of Earth, these EM spirals must connect with a series of other stellar Merkaba Field spirals in order for a \u201cfrequency bridge\u201d to be established between the higher and lower-dimensional Merkaba Field spirals. This frequency bridge occurs only during certain time periods, when the Merkaba Fields of these various star systems come into direct alignment with each other, four times every 26,556 years; twice at the beginning and twice at the end of the 26,556-year period. When this alignment of spiraling EM Merkaba Fields occurs, Earth has the opportunity to raise the pulsation speed of its particle base into that of higher-dimensional time cycles. At th",
