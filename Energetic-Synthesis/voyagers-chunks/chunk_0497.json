  "text": "purpose and experiential dramas within the lower dimensional fields of HU-1. The Superconscious Mind of the Soul Matrix replicates itself through electromagnetic fission then fragments the replica of its consciousness into sets of 12 individuated identities that become singular biological incarnational identities, which are simultaneously placed within the space-time fields of HU-1. Each of the 12 identities in an HU-1 set or \u201csoul family\u201d are directly connected to each other and to the original Superconscious Mind through the Morphogenetic Keylontic structure of the Soul Matrix. The Soul Matrix holds the developmental evolutionary blueprint and memory for each of its HU-1 incarnates and serves to guide the HU-1 incarnational personalities to their highest evolution through information communicated via electrical impulses sent into the HU-1 body through the Instinctual Mind. Within the Soul Matrix the memory of the purposes and intentions for each individual HU-1 life is stored as well as the memory of the greater purposes and intentions for the set of 12 simultaneous incarnations. Each HU-1 incarnate has free will and can choose to override the impulses sent to it by the Soul Matrix, but the highest evolution and greatest fulfillment of the incarnate comes from following the directives of the Superconscious Mind. The Superconscious Mind represents the creative and organization",
