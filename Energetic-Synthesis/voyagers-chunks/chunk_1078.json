  "text": "Time-Cycle Mechanics and Evolution 45\u00b0 shift is a 45\u00b0 reverse angular rotation of particle spin. Earth enters HU-2 with its particles at a 45\u00b0 angular rotation from their original position upon entering HU-1 (+90\u00b0, -45\u00b0 = +45\u00b0 shift). In the progression from one Har- monic Universe to the next, the angular rotation of particle spin moves for- ward 1/4th, then backward 1/8th of a full 360\u00b0 rotation. It is through the multidimensional relationships between angles of particle and anti-particle spin that multiple reality \ufb01elds can take place in the same space, while remaining invisible to each other. As a planet evolves through this process, the rate of particle pulsation, and thus the speed at which time moves, progressively increases, while the density of matter particles progressively decreases. This is the process of planetary evolution through the 15-dimensional scale. A planet moves from one dimensional frequency band to the next, and from one time continuum to the next, by magnetically drawing into its mor- phogenetic field, particles from the Unified Field of energy for each dimen- sion. When a planet has pulled in all the frequency patterns of one dimension into its morphogenetic field, it then moves upward into the next dimensional field to complete the same process. As a planet pulls in particles and patterns of frequency from the Unified Fields, its morphogenetic field",
