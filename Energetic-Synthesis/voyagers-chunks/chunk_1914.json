Keylon Codes serve to direct the in-\ufb02ow and out-\ufb02ow of Partiki unit energy within the morphogenetic blueprint of a form into more specific patterns, rhythms of movement and electro-tonal vibration. All forms of matter and conscious- ness are structured upon specific sets of Keylon Codes that determine the base atomic and genetic makeup of a form and the characteristics of consciousness the form will possess. Keylon Codes represent complex patterns of interwo- ven sound tones and light spectra that form compound morphogenetic crys- talline structures that serve as the templates of living light and sound to 455",
