The Amethyst Order Urtite-Cloister Maji Holy Grail line races of Seeding-3 are called the Urta seed race, most often referred to as the Ur. The Urtite-Cloister Amethyst Order Maji Christiac- Rishiac Holy Grail Lines are called the ''Keepers of the Violet Flame-Guard- ians of the Triadic Code ''6. The Urta, or Ur Seed Race Urtite-Tri-Cloister Maji Christiac-Rishiac Grail Line has a 31-36 Strand DNA Template. Like their kin, the two Secondary Palaidia Urtite-Bi-Cloister Maji Flame Keeper Holy Grail Line Seed Races, the Breanoua and Rama Seed Races, the Ur Seed Race in their present incarnations on Earth are called Type-2 Indigo Children; the Ur are Amethyst Order MC Indigos. The Amethyst Order Ur, and their ascendant race lines, are the only human races on Earth, other than the Mu\u2019a and Yu, whose DNA Templates are imbued with 48 7 of the 144 Universal Signet Master Key Codes corre- sponding to Universal Star Gates 5 through 8. The 36-Strand DNA Tem- plate Ur races have 48 of the 144 Universal Signet Master Key Codes, and 1152 8 of the 1728 Universal Encryption Key Codes, encoded in their DNA.",
