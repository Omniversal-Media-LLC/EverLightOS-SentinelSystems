In one Planetary 12-Cycle there are 864 Time Vectors.\u00b2 We each have one incarnate self in each of the 864 Time Vectors of one Planetary 12-Cycle and 864 corresponding selves in the Parallel Earth Planetary 12-Cycle. An Angelic Human with a 12- Strand DNA Template has 1728 simultaneous selves manifest within 1728 Time Vectors of Two Planetary 12-Cycles. ___________________________ 1. 216 selves x 4 Rounds = 864 selves + 86 anti-particle counterpart selves within the Par- allel earth system = 1728 selves. 2. 72 Time Vectors per Planetary Time Cycle x 3 Planetary Time Cycles = 216 x 4 Rounds = 864 Time Vectors. 296 1",
