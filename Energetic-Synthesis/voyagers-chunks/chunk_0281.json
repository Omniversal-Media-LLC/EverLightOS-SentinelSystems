We are referring here to its human members. Many others are involved but do not consciously know what they are submerged within. Once in, members rarely get out...alive. This may sound like some sort of plot from a communist regime, but it is in operation beneath the democracies of the world also. At least within the dictatorships the common people know they are not free and can make their choices accordingly. But in the democracies of the world the people believe in the freedoms provided by their constitutions and judicial systems. They believe they are free, and in one sense they are\u2014free from knowing that they are being compromised by an Interior Elite. Free from knowing what they are being subjected to at the hands of these hidden directors. Free to think that they alone are controlling their own destiny as they struggle to evolve within the status quo. Who do you think would benefit the most from having the public believe that UFOs were hoaxes and aliens imaginary? The public? Do you really think your national or personal security is being protected by having the public kept in the dark about the fact that humans are not the only or most intelligent form of life in the universe?",
