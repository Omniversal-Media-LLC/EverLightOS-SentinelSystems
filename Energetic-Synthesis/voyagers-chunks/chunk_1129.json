From the perspective of the fourth dimension (where human conscious- ness is presently stationed) the D-1 iron core crystal of anti-particle Earth, (that is stationed within the overtone D-2 frequency bands of the particle universe) and the D-1 iron core crystal of particle Earth, (that is stationed within the D-1 frequency bands of the particle universe), perceptually merge and appear as the Sun. The Sun appears to be separated by many miles from Earth. From this perspective, what appears to be the physical body of Earth is 164",
