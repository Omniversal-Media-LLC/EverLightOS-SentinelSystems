The DNA is created in physical terms as its already existing morphogenetic imprint passes through the Earth core morphogenetic field where the energy imprint for the DNA then picks up the particle patterns from the Earth that will \u201c\ufb02esh out\u201d the DNA imprint in terms of dense-matter particles. If certain frequencies /tones are missing from the Earth core, those frequencies carried in the DNA imprint cannot flesh out into matter particles, and the DNA will manifest without those tones in its operational strands. The Frequency Fence caused the third DNA strand to manifest without the seventh through the twelfth base tones and the seventh through the ninth overtones, which resulted in a genetic muta- tion for the human lineage. DREAMING, EGO, AND HIGHER SELF Dreaming The third DNA strand corresponds to the third-Solar Plexus chakra, and the third level of the bio-energetic field, the mental body. The DNA muta- tion caused a division, or missing frequency link, in the third DNA strand which manifested as a gap or void within areas of the bio-energetic system that corresponded to that strand.
