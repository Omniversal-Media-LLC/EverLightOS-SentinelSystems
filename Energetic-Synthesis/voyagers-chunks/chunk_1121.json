  "text": "t\u2019s shift from the time cycles of one Harmonic Universe into the time cycles of the next Harmonic Universe usually takes place in two phases. The overtone particle base transfers at the half-ascension cycle point and the magnetic par- ticle base shifts 2213 years later, at the end of the ascension cycle. The Bridge Zone Project will accelerate this process; the two phases of Earth\u2019s particle conversion from HU-1 to HU-2 will take place at once, between 2012 and 2017. The artificial time continuum into which Earth will shift exists between the natural time cycles of the third and fourth dimensions. In the natural procession of merging the grids of Earth and Tara, the Earth\u2019s grid progressively raises in speed, beginning 15-20 years before the half-cycle point. The pulsation rate of Earth\u2019s D-1 particles raises to the rhythm of D-4, Earth's D-2 pulsation rate accelerates to the rhythm of D-5 and Earth\u2019s D-3 par- 161",
