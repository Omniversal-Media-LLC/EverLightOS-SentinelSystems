Every human on Earth now is in some way energetically con- nected to the race morphogenetic field within the Sphere of Amenti, and it is through the Halls of Amenti (or through the Taran morphogenetic Sphere within one of the other 11 planets in your solar system) that you must ascend to fulfill your evolutionary imprint as souls and return to your Creator/Creative Source. ROOT RACES - CLOISTERED RACES Forming of the five physical Root Races and their Cloisters Blue Print For Evolution Through DNA Assembly Rescue Mission Stage 4 25,000,000 YA After the Staff of Amenti was set within the Sphere of Amenti at Earth's D-2 core, the forming of the five remaining Root Races began. The five Clois- tered Races within the morphogenetic field of the Sphere polarized, splitting their energy fields, each creating two smaller morphogenetic fields within the Sphere of Amenti. The 10 new spheres collectively held the blueprint for DNA strands one through 12. Each of the five Cloistered races was responsible for the evolution of one pair of these new morphogenetic fields.
