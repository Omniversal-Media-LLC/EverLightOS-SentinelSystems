Otherworld inhabitants, regardless of their manifest appearance, may equally represent expressions of the image of God, sharing with us the Divine Creative Essence. Origins, Science, Evidence and Interpretations Consideration 8: Did we evolve from early primates or primitive man? Presently large numbers of our populations do not seriously consider the possibilities of non-terrestrial genetic heritage or Visitor involvement with Earth, because our scientific paradigms have moved our attentions in other directions. In the recent past the theory of human origins promoted by the scientific community was that of the primate- evolutionist model. Applying the natural selection theory (survival of the fittest) of 19th century Charles Darwin to the human origins question, for a time it was believed that the Homo sapiens represented the cumulative evolutionary product of progressive genetic adaptation of early primate species. Our lineage was said to have its identifiable beginnings as early primates, to have progressed via evolution through various stages of primitive man, arriving at its present superior form in the Homo sapiens. Certain genetic similarities were detected between some primates, early man and the Homo sapiens human, but an irrefutable genetic bridge confirming the progression has not been",
