This process of progressive frequency infu- sion into the DNA, and the DNA-strand assembly it creates, gives you the perceived illusion of passage through linear time. The new frequencies progressively increase the pulsation rhythm of the particles that compose your body and consciousness, moving your conscious- ness into the next set of dimensional sub-frequency bands, while propelling the contents of one sub-frequency band below into manifest perception. The manifest illusion of moments passing forward in time within a physical reality represents your consciousness perceiving the progressive Activations of the last DNA strand you assembled. These progressive Activations of the last DNA strand occur as your consciousness progressively Initiates new sub-fre- quency patterns from its present dimensional focus, into the morphogenetic field. Time does not move forward, in fact, time does not move at all. The experience of progression through time is created as consciousness progres- sively draws into itself frequency patterns from the dimensional Unified Fields, which progressively expands the consciousness, morphogenetic field and physical body. The particles of which the body and con",
