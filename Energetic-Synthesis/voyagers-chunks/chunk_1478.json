  "text": "s) are points of planetary, galactic and uni- versal \u201cCo-resonant Continuum Alignment\u201d during which the divergent frequency rhythms characteristic to various planetary, galactic and universal Time Continua temporarily come into a state of vibrational co-resonance (simultaneously reach the same vibration-oscillation rhythm). Points of temporary vibrational co-resonance that naturally occur between various Time Continua allow the usually separated Time Continua of various systems to cross through and open into each other . Star Gates represent the geographical and spatial coordinates at which the vibrational co-resonance of multiple Time Continua regularly occurs in fixed, repeating cycles of Co-resonant Continuum Alignment. At points in a Time Contin- uum where Co-resonant Vibrational Alignments occur, natural Star Gates open in the spatial coordinates that mark the points of vibrational co-reso- nance or continuum cross-through. Star Gates remain open until the vibra- tional rhythms of the various interfacing Time Continua at the Star Gate points begin to cycle out of vibrational co-resonance, shifting the various Time Continua out of Co-resonant Continuum Alignment. Star Gate close as the various Time Continua move past their vibrationally co-reso- nant \u201ccross-over\u201d points , and return to their respective fixed, repeating cycles of vibrational variance.
