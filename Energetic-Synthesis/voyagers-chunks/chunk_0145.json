Your scientists will not find much evidence of these cultures until they break the primary codes of your three-dimensional time structure. There are time zones within your universe, as well as multiple dimensions of those time zones. Though the mechanics of these two systems are intertwined they represent two separate areas of study. The Time Portal System, as we call it, involves a system of interlocking passageways that keep in motion a set of \u201clocks\u201d or \u201cgates\u201d between time elements in your linear time structure within your three- dimensional frequency band. The Dimensional Lock System differs from the Time Portal System in that its mechanics operate and maintain the dimensions and frequency bands themselves linking multi- dimensional universes not just time zones within the same universe/dimension. The Visitors In terms of your \u201calien\u201d visitors, or extraterrestrials, we are referring specifically to those visitors who approach your reality from within the Time Portal System.
