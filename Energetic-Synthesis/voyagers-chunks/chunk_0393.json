Codes were fired that did not have their counterpart \u201creceivers\u201d within the operating DNA and the energy released by these code firings could not be filtered into the biological organism. Instead, this \u201cerrant energy\u201d began to \u201cpool\u201d within the higher frequency sense facilities, distorting the natural order of those structures. The distortions emerged into the conscious awareness as errant emotional impulse, creating overly aggressive and inappropriate emotional reaction patterns that entered into the body through the existing \u201cfight or flight\u201d code structures that had been in operation. The fight or flight instinct pattern became overburdened with these unorganized electrical impulses, and the chemical and hormonal process of the body became unbalanced, creating the propensity for violent behavior now apparent within your human strain. As this sequence interruption occurred within the cellular imprint and was \u201cput on line,\u201d through the operative \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d codes in the DNA, this distortion was genetically passed on through your species lineage appearing in sporadic and random manifestations of biological mutation and psychological mal alignment.",
