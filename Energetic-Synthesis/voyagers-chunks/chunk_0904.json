Using manual labor, the Great Pyramid was restored around 5,546 BC, as a religious center through which the Arc of the Covenant was fortified and secured, but the structure no longer served as an interstellar teleport due to the pole tilt resulting from the Atlantean cataclysm and the Frequency Fence of 9,540 BC. The Sphinx was reconstructed around 5,466 BC, the contours of the structure's facial features were altered to more closely resemble the appear- ance of the Serres-Egyptian line, and the stronger, more exaggerated facial features characteristic to the Anunnaki lineage (who originally designed the structure in 46,459 BC) were omitted from the reconstruction. The form of the Leonine body remained as a tribute to remembered gods of Egyptian mythology, who represented symbolic trace memories of ancient Anunnaki affiliations with the HU-2 Leonine races. The early dynastic periods of Egypt emerged around 3,500 BC, bearing increasing influence of cultural in\ufb02ux from various other regions. The Arc of the Covenant, Sphere of Amenti and the tools of the Rod and the Staff became closely guarded secrets, held within the con\ufb01nes of select Serres-Egyptian and Melchizedek Cloister families with whom the Priests of Ur continued covert contact. 86",
