  "text": "assembly, the Cellular Mem- ory, which is subconsciously stored within the cellular-body consciousness, progressively opens into conscious perceptual recognition. In your current time continuum, you technically have one-half cycle remaining within your third-dimensional time cycle. Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field has pulled in only half of the frequency patterns of the third dimension. There is a direct correlation between how many frequency patterns the Earth has pulled into its morphogenetic \ufb01eld and the type of consciousness and biology that will appear on the Earth at that stage of evolution. We call the amount of frequency Earth has pulled into its morphogenetic field, from the dimensional uni fied fields, its Accretion Level. Earth is presently at the 2.5-accretion level\u2014Earth has pulled into its mor- phogenetic field all of the D-1 and D-2 frequency patterns, and half of the fre- quency patterns of D-3. Earth would normally pass into HU-2 time cycles at accretion level 3. Normally the three accretion level of Earth would not be reached until 4230 AD. The life-forms on a planet at the 2.5-accretion level will have a consciousness that falls near the 3.5 range. Consciousness will per- ceive as solid matter and external reality the level of Earth\u2019s body that is one full dimension/Quadrant below the accretion level of the consciousness. Present human consciousness has an average",
