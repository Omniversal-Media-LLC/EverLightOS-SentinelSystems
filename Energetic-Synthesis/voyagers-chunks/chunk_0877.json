The process of a soul essence birthing out of the morphogenetic field of the Sphere of Amenti involves the essence pass- ing out of its morphogenetic field and into the morphogenetic field of the planet onto which it will birth. Once a soul essence has entered its planetary morphogenetic field, it will then pass into the fetal pattern that was created for its entry, and fetal integration of the soul consciousness occurs. As the individualized morphogenetic field of the soul essence passes through the planetary morphogenetic field, it picks up the frequency patterns characteris- tic to the planetary core, which allows the essence to \u201cground\u201d its identity within the collective energy imprint of the planet. After the Frequency Fence was applied and some of the third-dimen- sional tones were removed from the planetary morphogenetic field, soul essences passing through the Earth core for birthing could not ground the full imprint for the third DNA strand, as the missing third-dimensional tones would not allow the companion codes from the soul morphogenetic field to plug into the Earth's morphogenetic field. The DNA is created in physical terms as its already existing morphogenetic imprint passes through the Earth core morphogenetic field where the",
