Keylon Codes create and hold together the primary morphogenetic structure of individuated form; they are the primary structure and organiza- tional collective intelligence within all things. The manifest attributes of all matter forms and consciousness can be affected through directed alteration of existing Keylon Code structures. Keylon Codes represent the compound tapestries of crystalline morphogenetic matter blueprints upon which pre-matter, anti-matter and matter particles will form. They are the \ufb01fth state of being between pure consciousness and form mani- festation and serve as the complex, multidimensional, morphogenetic blueprint through which all individuated forms manifest. 5. The Crystal Body: This term is used to refer to the multidimensional Keylon Code structure of a matter form or form of consciousness. The Crystal Body represents the individuated morphogenetic construction of a form through which the contours of its manifest attributes will take shape. The morphogenetic Crystal Body sets the manifest characteristics a form will pos- sess, its intrinsic sub-atomic structure, body rhythms, metabolic rate and the foundations of DNA, the manner in which Partiki units will move through the form and the type of conscious awareness the form will embody.
