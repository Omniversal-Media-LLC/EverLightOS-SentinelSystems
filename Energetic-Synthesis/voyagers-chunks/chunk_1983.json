DNA Fire Codes\u2014Activation Codes: Units of minute crystalline fre- quency within the dimensional morphogenetic imprint for the DNA that link DNA strands together and allow for cellular transmutation, teleporta- tion, time travel and dimensional ascension to take place. Also referred to as Codes of Transmutation or Genetic Time Codes. One DNA Fire Code corresponds to each Star Crystal Seal. Each DNA strand contains half of the Fire Code that corresponds to the Star Crystal Seal from the dimen- sional band above the dimensional band to which the DNA strand corre- sponds. It also contains half of the Fire Code corresponding to the Star Crystal Seal from the dimensional band below that corresponding to the strand. The DNA Fire Codes allow one DNA strand to \u201cplug into\u201d and fuse with another. When DNA strands fuse, the Base Codes and Acceleration Codes of one strand merge with those of the strand above, fusing particles and anti-particles between dimensional bands. This allows the three parti- cle bases of a three-dimensional human body to merge, the separation between them dissolving. When the three-dimensional particle bases of a body in one Harmonic Universe merge, the particles and anti-particles are able to rapidly accelerate pulsation rhythm, turn into light waves and transmute into the dimensional bands of the Harmonic Universe above. The Fire Codes activate when the",
