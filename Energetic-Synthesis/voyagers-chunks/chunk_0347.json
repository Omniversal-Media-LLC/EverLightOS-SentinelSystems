Through experimentation upon these hybrid creatures the Drakon were able to access some of the Keylonta Code particles that held in place the original human frequency fence. They \u201cpoked holes in\u201d the existing fence (having no idea of the potential results of their actions), which began a process of \u201cinformation leakage\u201d from the Host Soul Matrices. The human mind and body were not yet mature enough to assimilate these code fragments effectively, and the fragments began to set in motion activation of the stored original Soul Matrix codes (\u201cjunk DNA\u201d). This created havoc within the developing human biology, as a resurgence of the \u201cghost\u201d cellular imprints began. It was during these times that the aforementioned Zionites (time traveling Zeta-human- Aethien hybrid from \u201cthe future\u201d time co-ordinates), first intervened, in hope of accelerating the biological evolution of the species by creating hybrids among a select group of humans. These humans were chosen randomly throughout the 12 tribes, and were imbued with the Silicate Matrix from the Zionite code. This allowed them to synthesize, through a course of several generations, the Host Matrix code patterns that had \u201cleaked\u201d through the holes in the frequency fence.
