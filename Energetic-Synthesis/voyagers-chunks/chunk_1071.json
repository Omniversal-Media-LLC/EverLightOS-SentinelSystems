The Earth\u2019s grid speed would be increased to a level that the Frequency Fence EM pulses could not reach. The Dracos-Zeta Resistance would not have enough time to decipher new calculations, and once Earth was stabilized in the Bridge Zone D-3.5 time continuum, and under full Guardian protection, the Dracos-Zetas could not successfully launch an infiltration. Furthermore, if Earth was successfully shifted, and its frequency raised sufficiently, the Dracos-Zetas would lose control of their Fre- quency Fence and their human captives in the D-4 cycle. For humanity to shift into the Bridge Zone with Earth, the populations would have to fully assemble their DNA to the 4.5 -strand level, and a minimum of 8% would have to assemble 144",
