The Root Race held the lower frequency base tone codes of this Earth. Once both sets of DNA codes were assembled in the DNA through the 24 transmutations, the overtone activation codes from the Cloister would allow the incarnate to enter its Cloister's morphogenetic field within the Sphere of Amenti, where DNA strands 7\u201412 would \u201cplug into\u201d the activation codes. This would open the morphogenetic field of the Palaidorian collective (five Clois- tered Races), where the codes of the other Root Races could be assembled and the full 12-strand DNA pattern would be restored. As this process of DNA activation took place, the incarnate was enabled to enter the Blue Flame mor- phogenetic field of Tara with its consciousness, which began activation of DNA strands 7-l2 within the body. This process increased the rate of pulsation of the matter particles of the body into HU-2 patterns, which allowed the incarnate to turn its body into light, pass through the Halls of Amenti as pure energy, then re-manifest within a less dense version of that body upon Tara. The 24 transmutations were lived in one body, which progressively transmuted as the DNA assembled, unt",
