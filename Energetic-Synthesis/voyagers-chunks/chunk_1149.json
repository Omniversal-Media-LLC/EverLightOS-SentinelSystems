Once they land on Tara, the Transport V oyagers will experience the same orientation events as those who ascended directly through the Halls of Amenti. All V oy- agers will have a companion assigned to them following their arrival on Tara. The companion will assist them in adjusting to the new reality, and will remain with them until the V oyager has comfortably integrated into Taran culture. Some V oyagers, who have fully assembled the sixth DNA strand and have reached an accretion level of 6, will have the opportunity to ascend beyond Tara in HU-2, to Gaia in HU-3 or into the Meta-galactic Core at D-8 and completely leave matter form, the dimensional system and Time Matrix. This is the path of full mastery. Normally it is available to only the few who are born into the highest resonating genetic codes. Due to Earth\u2019s upcoming infu- sion of fifth-dimensional frequency, in the Bridge Zone time track, the fifth DNA strand assembly will be made available to everyone who works con- sciously to assimilate the D-5 frequency into the body. Once the fifth DNA strand is assembled, assembly of the sixth strand begins, and some individuals will be able to fully assemble the sixth strand between 2012-2017, while the Halls of Amenti and portals to Tara and Gaia are opened",
