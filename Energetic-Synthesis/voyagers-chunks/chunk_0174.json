  "text": "You are responsible for your own awareness and for the choices you make that will either expand that awareness toward enlightenment or plunge you into darkness and fear. We highly suggest that you pull yourselves out of the program and begin, as individuals, to ask the right questions concerning your planet, your government, your \u201cexperts,\u201d and the beliefs you have accepted regarding the true nature of reality. The information we provide regarding the Zeta and the formation of the Interior Government is intended to inspire you to ask who is pulling your strings as individuals. The greater amount of information you have at your disposal the better able you will be to make informed decisions and wise choices. We are not suggesting an overt rebellion against authority as you know it, but simply the use of a discerning eye when being presented with views by those authorities. In looking within yourselves and beginning to explore the portions of your identity and knowing that live within, you will discover alternative perspectives to choose from. You will have more information from which to draw your conclusions, and you will find many more questions to ask that the program itself cannot provide answers for. By asking the right questions you will begin a personal spiritual odyssey that will lead you above and beyond the program into the rightful enlightenment that is your next stage",
