If Earth\u2019s core had not been raised to a high enough particle pulsation rhythm, via the Guardians D-4 frequency transmissions, the Solar Spiral would not have been able to transmit its D-4 frequencies into Earth's core when the Solar Spiral aligns with Earth\u2019s Merkaba Fields on 5/5/2000. Earth would have been unable to begin its Stellar Activations and Wave Infusion cycle, and thus would have remained trapped within the D-3 time continuum, unable to enter the Bridge Zone continuum. The outcome of this would have been planetary destruction in 2976 AD, due to Dracos-Zeta Resistance infiltration. We want you to understand the 472",
