  "text": "Seed Crystal Seal directs the Seed Code of one strand of DNA. The Star Crystal Seals of the bio-energetic body also cor- respond to the DNA. Within the morphogenetic imprint for human DNA there are dormant gene codes that correspond to the Star Crystal Seals; as long as the Star Crystal Seals are not activated, these gene codes will remain dormant. Each Star Crystal Seal is composed of half of the frequency patterns of the dimension above it and half of those from the dimension below. There are 12 dormant DNA codes corresponding to 12 Star Crystal Seals and each code carries the frequencies and light spectra contained within the Star Crystal Seal. These dormant gene codes allow for the sepa- rate DNA strands to \u201cplug into each other\u201d, a condition necessary for Cellu- lar Transmutation. The 12 dormant gene codes corresponding to 12 of the 15 Star Crystal Seals are individually referred to as Genetic Time Codes, Codes of Transmutation or Fire Codes. Collectively the 12 Fire Codes are known as the Silicate Matrix or the Crystal Gene. This is the original gene construc- tion of the human organism. Due to various genetic mutations, a very small percentage of humans presently carry the entire Silicate Matrix in the personal morphogenetic imprint for the DNA. Through distortions within the DNA Seed Codes, the Fire Codes of the Silicate Matrix break down and can no longer function. Wit",
