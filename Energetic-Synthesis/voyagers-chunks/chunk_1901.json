  "text": "Appendix II Introduction to Keylonta THE SCIENCE OF LIGHT, SOUND, THE SUB-CONSCIOUS SYMBOL CODES, AND THE BASE CODES OF MATTER Exploring Ultra-Micro Particle Mechanics Keylonta is the science of energy dynamics as they apply to a multidi- mensional, perpetual motion universe. lt is the primary foundation upon which all advanced sciences and technologies of light, sound, frequency, and electromagnetic energy are built. Keylontic Science deals with the underly- ing structures of electromagnetic energy through which all matter forms are constructed and with the attributes of electro-tonal energy structure through which consciousness achieves diversification and individuation. Foundations of Keylontic Science arise out of a larger category of multidimensional scien- tific study known as the Science of Vibrational Mechanics. The Science of Vibrational Mechanics utilizes a schematic of cosmic order that is created through the inherent dynamics of fission and fusion of electro-tonal energy units, an order through which the natural laws of the cosmos are set and held in motion. Keylontic Science employs these natural laws as they apply to the structures and dynamics of energy, matter and consciousness that are created through these laws. Keylonta can be viewed as the science of creation, for it is through the dynamics of Keylontic Science that creation takes place. There is an organiza",
