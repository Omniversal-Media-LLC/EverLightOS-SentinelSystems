When the electromagnetic Merkaba Fields of the Sun are artificially manipulated, such as they were by the Zetas following the Philadelphia Experiment, erratic electrical energies build up within the Sun\u2019s energetic grid, throwing all of the Sun\u2019s Merkaba Fields out of balance. As the misalignment of the Sun\u2019s EM fields progresses, it manifests as an acceleration of solar-\ufb02are activity, which eventually culmi- nates in surface explosions and temporary expansion of the Sun\u2019s Merkaba Fields, lasting about 950-970 years. In 1972, the first explosions began to occur. The explosions would have continued until about September of 1973, when the Sun\u2019s D-1 Merkaba Field would have burst open and expanded. The expansion of the Sun\u2019s D-1 Merke aba Field would have sent an intense wave of ULF energy out through all of the planets in the local solar system. This wave of energy would cause a chain reaction within all of the planetary Merkaba Fields, through which pole reversal and vaporization of surface life would result. This wave of expanding D-I energy is called a Red Pulse (red denoting its D-I frequency), and it constitutes a wave of solar \ufb02ame within the D-1 frequency bands. Life- forms on planets in the First Harmonic Universe cannot survive such an infu-",
