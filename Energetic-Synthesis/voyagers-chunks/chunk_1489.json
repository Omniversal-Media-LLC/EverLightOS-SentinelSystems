The pattern of Fallen Angelic Invasion culminating in pole shift that was set during the last consummated SAC has repeated in each Evolutionary Round since the pattern was set in 208,216 BC in our Time Continuum. This Plane- tary Karma pattern is presently set in Earth\u2019s grids as a misaligned series of Fire Letter Sequences, which will cause the pattern to repeat again during the 2000-2017 SAC. \u2022 Pole Shift in our present Time Vector can be averted by realigning the cor- rected Fire Letter Sequences in Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields between 2001-2012. This will enable Earth to shift into Trans-Time Alignment with the Time Continuum in which the other three Rounds of the Chris- tos Realignment Mission are occurring successfully; the Christos Re- alignment Mission will thus finally reach completion. 293",
