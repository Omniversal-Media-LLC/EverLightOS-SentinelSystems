The hole was finally located and identified by observing the rate and form of depletion of controlled samples of the outer atmosphere. The depletion rate was accelerated when the samples were placed in various locations upon the planet. They were able to pinpoint the hole by observing particle movement and \u201cfollowing the path\u201d of accelerated particle depletion for the element in question. They were able to \u201cfollow the beacons\u201d emitted by the particles within the hole but only to a certain point at which the beacons (minute electrical emissions) would disappear. It took several generations to discover that these particles were pulling in an exponentially expansive quantity of matter. The particles would disappear as the \u201cscrambling\u201d of their base time code structure occurred. The original code was unraveled, its elements disbursed within the reality fields of the black hole. The Zeta realized that this condition was a result of the dimensional blend, and so they hoped that by \u201cundoing\u201d the blend and closing the mediation zone between the dimensional portals that had been forced open, that they could effectively disengage the black hole. What they did not realize is that once a hole is created it will conti",
