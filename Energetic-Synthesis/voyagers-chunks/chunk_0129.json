We are referring here to those reported sightings of seemingly mechanical-type vessels of transport that have no apparent terrestrial origin. In this category we shall also place other airborne phenomena of related characteristics, but those which lack the elements of mechanical type vestiges. The latter are usually described as Light Formations, reportedly witnessed both at close range and great distances. Both types of UFOs have at times appeared in radar tracking, as well as having many eyewitness reports of sightings or encounters with such yet unexplained phenomena. Photographs and film have at times captured images of both types of UFO presence. In attempting to explain the origins of such phenomena it is necessary to broach the issue of human physics. Some understanding of the nature of time, matter and perception is required if sense is to be made of these events. In regard to the solid object UFOs often witnessed and documented, suffice it to say that these objects are existing (at the time of encounter) within the range of perception of three- dimensionality. That is, these objects are functioning within the same time-space continuum as other objects within the earth's objectively perceivable and measurable",
