Incarnational Identities, the Time Cycles, DNA and Planetary Evolution The evolution of life-forms upon the planet also takes place simulta- neously, and, at any given time, activity takes place within each of the six time continua. As the planet evolves, so does the consciousness stationed upon that planet. Reincarnational identities represent portions of a person\u2019 s soul aware- ness that are simultaneously stationed and evolving upon a version of the planet within each of the six time continuum cycles of an Euiago cycle. Usually, a soul - HU-2 identity, manifests into 12 simultaneous incarnations, two in each of the six time cycles in one Harmonic Universe. In each pair of incarnates, one is male, the other female; this relationship is referred to as \u201ctwin \ufb02ames\u201d, but does not necessarily imply a romantic \u201csoul mate\u201d involvement. The over soul\u2014the HU-3 identity\u2014 creates 12 soul identities in HU-2, each of which create 12 incarnates within the six time cycles of HU-1. Thus, each person is part of an incarnational family of 144 incarnates residing within the six HU-l time cycles. Each of the 144 incarnates carries part of the 12-strand DNA pattern within the genetic code. As the 144 incarnates simultaneously evolve with the planet through the six",
