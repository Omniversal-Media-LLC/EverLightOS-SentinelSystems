On Monday September 3, 2001, the last day of our Labor Day Workshop, the CIA/Eieyani informed us that the UIR had begun a certain type of \u201cPhantom Pulse\u201d transmission through the Montauk-Phi-Ex Falcon APIN System, which interrelates with UIR Beamships via the earthly HAARP network. The Eieyani explained that the UIR had begun linking their D-4 Cloaked Beamship crafts into the hidden HAARP installations (see page 257) to begin Frequency Fence transmission now, rather than waiting until their originally scheduled target date of 2004. These transmissions are intended to rapidly lower the NET Frequency Fence into the 3-D frequency bands to prevent continuation of the Spontaneous Mass Human DNA Template Awakening that is now occurring. The GA have since explained that the HAARP facility in Alaska is the least powerful of all and was not the facility from which the August 12, 2001, pulses were launched. The Alaskan HAARP was created as a '' decoy''\u2014there are 12 other similar facilities on Phantom Earth, that interface with our Earth via the Falcon APIN system and the Drakonian-controlled sites of the Nibiruian Crystal Temple Network. 4 The Phantom Earth HAARPs, originally Zeta-Rigelian technologies, are the intended primary transmission stations in the OWO agenda. Unfortunately, Angels do Play These HAARPs\u2014 fallen angels",
