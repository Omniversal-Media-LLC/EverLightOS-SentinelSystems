Once the cycle of dimensional blending was through, the Flame would be placed back in the Sphere and the remaining populations would continue to evolve on Earth until the next morphogenetic wave. The people who were able to catch the first wave would find themselves teleported into the future, where they would appear on the Taran land mass that was once called the continent of Mu.
