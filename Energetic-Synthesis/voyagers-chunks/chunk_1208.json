This individual was born with the eighth DNA strand fully activated. As his soul essence passed through the Sphere of Amenti, the imprint for DNA strand 3 was realigned with the 12-strand DNA pattern and the corrected third strand imprint began transmitting through Earth\u2019s grid. By 1996 there was great concern among Guardian races, as to whether Earth\u2019s grid speed would be raised high enough by 6/30/1998 to spark the sec- ond seal on the Arc of the Covenant. If the second seal did not open by this date, Earth could not begin its ascent into pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time cycle for merger with Tara. If Earth\u2019s grid speed was not high enough to spark open the second Seal on the Arc of the Covenant by June 30, 1998, the Bridge Zone Project would not succeed. The Halls of Amenti would not open. The Earth would be unable to shift into the D-4 time cycle by 1/2012 and the Dracos-Zeta Resis- tance would have a much better chance of creating the 2003 experiment and 2004 Frequency Fence. If Earth was unable to begin shift into a D-4 particle pulsation rhythm by 5/5/2000, sporadic Earth changes would erupt between 2012-2017, as the grids of Earth and Tara attempted to merge, and the oppor- tunity for ascension would be lost. Guardians were permitted by the HU-2",
