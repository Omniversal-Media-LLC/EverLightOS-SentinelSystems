  "text": "th spends two Time Continuum cycles within the anti- particle universe, while during the same period, parallel anti-particle Earth spends two continuum cycles in the particle universe. (This is done through complex dynamics involving the reversal of electromagnetic polarity and shifting of the angular rotation of particle spin). During the two continuum cycles when the planets switch places within their respective universes, any matter constructions created on those planets will be composed of particles or anti-particles inherent to the universe within which the planet is stationed. Objects and biological remains of civilizations taking place on Earth while it is in the anti- particle universe will be composed of anti-particles. As Earth passes back into the time continua cycles of the particle universe, most matter constructions and remains from Earth\u2019s parallel universe period will remain within the anti-particle universe. Remains of activity taking place on the anti-particle parallel Earth while it is in the particle universe, will likewise remain in the particle universe. As the planets simultaneously transition back to their home universe, the remains of one planet will appear within the physical particle base of the other planet. This implies that remains found on our Earth, that can be dated to the periods when Earth was in the parallel universe, are actually the",
