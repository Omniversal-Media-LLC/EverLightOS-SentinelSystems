It exists as a minute crystal encased in elemental iron and serves to ground Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field into HU-1. Surrounding this iron core crystal of D-1 is the D-2 Merkaba Field, which is located within the Earth\u2019s core at the D-2 frequency level and serves to hold the morphogenetic imprint and parti- cle base of Earth in place. Earth\u2019s D-3 Merkaba Field extends about 444,000 miles out into space and serves to hold Earth\u2019s atmosphere in place. (The hole in Earth\u2019s ozone layer represents a disruption within Earth's D-3 Merk- aba Field). The D-4 Merkaba Field of Earth exists as a minute crystal encased in ele- mental gold, which is presently located within a black hole at the center of Earth\u2019s Sun at the D-4 frequency level. It serves to ground Tara\u2019s morphoge- netic field (portions of which are presently scattered within the planetary cores of your solar system) into HU-2, and also connects the planets of your solar system in HU-l to Tara\u2019s D-5 core in HU-2. Tara-Earth\u2019s D-5 Merkaba Field surrounds the D-4 gold crystal at the Sun\u2019s core at the level of fifth-dimensional frequency, and thus your Sun and solar system are encased within this fifth-dimensional Merkaba Field. The D- 5 Merkaba Field serves to hold Tara-Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field and particle base in place. Tara-Earth\u2019s D-6 Merkaba",
