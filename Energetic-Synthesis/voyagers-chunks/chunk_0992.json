Ideally, the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field and the Blue Flame Staff of Amenti, Earth\u2019s portion of Tara\u2019s morphogenetic field, will be placed within this time-warp portal in Earth\u2019s D-2 core during the half-point in the second ascension cycle. During this 10-year period, the Halls of Amenti portal passages to Tara, and to other time fields of Earth in HU-1, become open to the masses. In order for the morphogenetic wave, mass ascension and evolutionary leap in time to occur, the Sphere of Amenti must be held and opened within the D-2 Earth core morphogenetic field, and the Blue Flame must be embodied within 8% of Earth\u2019s populations. Individuals whose body, bio-energetic field and consciousness pulsate at the rate of fifth-dimensional frequency will experientially perceive either direct, bodily transmutation through a time portal passage from Earth to Tara, or a time travel transport to Tara via inte",
