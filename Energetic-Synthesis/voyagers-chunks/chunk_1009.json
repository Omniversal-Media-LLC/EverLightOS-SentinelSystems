These events are taking place now, in that future time-space coordinate. In order for the Zetas to retain control over that society, they have trav- eled backward through time to Earth\u2019 s present. Humanity\u2019s upcoming opportu- nity for accelerated evolution between 2012-2017 AD poses a direct threat to the Zetas\u2019 ability to retain control of that society. If 8% of present day humans are able to successfully take this evolutionary leap, the humans of 4230 AD-6443 AD will be set free from the Zeta Collective Mind Frequency Fence through which they are presently controlled in their space-time coor- dinate. The Zetas do not want this to occur. The Zetas\u2019 original Earth agenda involved first creating Zeta-human hybrid strains that could comfortably thrive on Earth. In the second phase of their plan, they intended to make sure that the grids of Earth and Tara did not merge during the 2012-2017 half-cycle point. By stopping this event, Earth would remain trapped in HU-1 for another 26,556-year cycle, and the human populations could not accelerate their evolution and activate their fifth DNA strand. If the Zetas could keep Earth in the HU-1 time band and gain control of the planet here, they would insure the continuation of their future stronghol",
