Once it enters the hole the time sequence organization that it originally carried as part of the Time Matrix becomes scrambled and the energy is no longer able to reenter the Time Matrix from the position in which it first entered the hole. This \u201cenergy\u201d can take the form of an individual in biological form, a personal Soul Matrix or \u201csoul,\u201d a planet or galaxy or the entire galactic Soul Matrix. When one element from within a given time continuum enters the hole, its own sequential program will serve as a \u201cbeacon\u201d for all other energies possessing that particular coding. This beacon not only \u201cbroadcasts\u201d its signal back into the Time Matrix through its electrical particles (which act as transmitters) but it also begins to draw in like energy through its magnetic particles (which act as magnetic receivers). The element lost within the hole then pulls in more and more energy from its home system. The \u201choles\u201d we are referring to are, of course, the phenomena you describe as Black Holes. As described in previous sections, the Zeta originally entered your system as they searched for solutions involving conditions that occurred upon their own planet, Apaxein Lau. The \u201cconditions\u201d the Zeta hoped to remedy are precisely those described above. Through their",
