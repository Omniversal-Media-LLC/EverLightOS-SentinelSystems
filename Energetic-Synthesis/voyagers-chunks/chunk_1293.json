In 1/2014 the Keepers of the Blue Flame are half way through their D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core Activation, the Blue-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusion that began in 3/2012 completes and the D-10/ D-11 Silver-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusion begins. Through these D- 10/D-11 Wave Infusions, the D-10 base tone and D-11 overtone frequen- cies, and imprints for DNA strands 10 and 11, enter into the morphoge- netic fields of the Blue Flame Keepers. The Blue and Violet Flame Keepers will complete their D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core Activations and D-10/ D-11 Silver-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusions during the Three-day par- ticle conversion period in 20I7. 32. June 2014: Earth Completes its Gold Wave Infusion. Earth completes its first cycle of three Transmutative Stellar Wave Infu- sions. The D-7/D-8 Gold Wave Infusion that began in 6/2010 completes. Through the completion of the Wave Infusion D-7 base tone and D-8 overtone, frequencies are entered into Earth's core morphogenetic field and will begin transmitting through Earth\u2019s grid on day-1 of the 2017 3- day period, when Earth\u2019s D-8/D-9 Silver Wave Infusion begins. Earth will not begin its second cycle of three Stellar Wave Infusions until the Three- day particle conversion period of 2017, when Earth rapidly fulfills its D-7 Arct",
