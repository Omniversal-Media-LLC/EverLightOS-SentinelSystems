  "text": "the reader may understand the evolutionary promise implied by the Voyagers worldview. It is a promise that reminds us of the majesty of our Divine nature and reaffirms our connection to a sacred Creation. In the remainder of this Introduction I will share some considerations concerning contemporary belief paradigms, that helped me to recognize the potential validity of the Voyagers perspective. It is not my intention to challenge or negate the validity of popular assumptions, but I hope to offer some additional insights into these assumptions and to provide possible alternative perspectives through which the facts can be viewed. The following Considerations and Conclusions represent my personal perspectives; I do not ask you to accept my opinions as your own, but only to consider them as potentially interesting points of view through which greater understanding might be gained. The Ordinary Extraordinary In our contemporary world we are progressively presented with more and more experiences and occurrences of an extraordinary nature. Over the past 20 years alone it seems as if the extraordinary has taken on a life of its own. People now routinely report extraordinary experiences, such as psychic phenomena, Out-of-body-episodes, Near- death-experiences, hauntings, channeling of disembodied spirits, visitation by angels, sightings of UFOs and abductions by aliens, to name a few.",
