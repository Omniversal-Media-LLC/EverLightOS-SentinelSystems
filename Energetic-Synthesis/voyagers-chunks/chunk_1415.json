The Oraphim Cetaceans created several Dolphin and Whale species on Earth, to serve as their emissaries in maintain- ing Earth\u2019s biosphere. The fallen Annu-Elohim Bipedal Dolphin People have also seeded several strains of Dolphin, Whale and Shark species into Earth\u2019s biosphere, in attempt to gain sonic control over Earth\u2019s Manifestation Tem- plate. Though it is nearly impossible to detect the differences between the Oraphim Cetacean and Annu-Elohim Cetacean species, there are a few sub- tle differences observable between them. Oraphim Cetacean strains tend to be lighter in skin color , are more vegetarian in diet, prefer warmer waters, are more receptive to human contact, have a more gentle, feminine mater- nal nature and emit higher-pitched sound frequencies than their fallen Annu-Elohim Cetacean kin. In their organic state, when they are not intermingling with other race strains for the purpose of assisting in DNA Bio-Regenesis programs, the Ora- phim Feline-Avian-Cetacean-Humans have full conscious power over phys- ical manifestation and de-manifestation, allowing them adaptability to almost any environment and Density Level in which they are placed.
