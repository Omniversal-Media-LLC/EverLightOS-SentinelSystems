It is the present focus of your consciousness that magnetically draws frequency patterns from the dimensional Unified Field into your personal morphogenetic field. Once your consciousness has moved into one sub-frequency band, it pulls that frequency pattern into the morphogenetic field, the morphogenetic field manifests that frequency pattern into the corresponding DNA strand and shifts the conscious- ness to the next sub-frequency band up. Whatever thoughts you held at one station of consciousness become programmed into the DNA strand that corre- sponds to the dimension in which that thought was held. A thought-form cre- ated while the consciousness is focused in D-4 becomes a manifest part of the fourth DNA strand and is entered into the Cellular Memory stored within the sub-atomic particles of which the body cells are composed. Once the personal morphogenetic field has pulled in all of the 12 sub- frequency bands in one dimension, the full DNA strand corresponding to that dimension is fully assembled and the consciousness is transferred into the first sub-frequency bands of the next dimension up. We call the point of evolution when the full DNA strand is assembled the Consummation and the point when the consciousness transfers into the first sub-frequency band of the next dimension up the Initiation.
