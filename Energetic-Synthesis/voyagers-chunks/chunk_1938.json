They will also expe- rience varying degrees of disruption within their personal auric field, chakra system, DNA and physical, mental and emotional bodies. The Transmutative Activations are referred to as Stellar Activations because the infusions of progressively higher-dimensional frequency bands that transmit into the auric fields of Earth and humans, enter into the Earth\u2019s bio-energetic field through a chain of spiraling, dimensional Merkaba Fields. The frequency infusions come to Earth following a path of Merkaba Fields that runs through various star systems before entering Earth\u2019s system through the Pleiadian-Alcyone and Solar spirals. The six Transmutative Activations, with which we are now concerned, interface with Earth through the following spiraling, inter-stellar energetic path: D-10 Lyra-Andromeda, D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core Morphogenetic Field, D-8 Meta-galactic Core and Orion, D-7 Arcturus, D-6 Sirius, D-5 Ple- iades-Alcyone, D-4 Solar Spiral, D-3 Earth. As each of these spiraling Stellar Merkaba Fields come into alignment with each other and with the three- dimensional Merkaba Fields of Earth, the frequency patterns associated with each spiral progressively enter into the Earth\u2019s bio-energetic system and core. This infusion of multidimensional frequency, which transmits to Earth in",
