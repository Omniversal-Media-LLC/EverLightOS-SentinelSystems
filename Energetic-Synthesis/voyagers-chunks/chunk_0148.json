  "text": "There are various sub-species of the Zeta prototype, some more \u201chybrid like\u201d in appearance, some resembling other forms not at all organic to your system. There are lizard-like Zeta in numerous colorings and sizes. There are Zeta that more closely resemble your insect kingdoms, particularly that of the arachnid (spider-like) though somewhat larger than your earthly versions. Other types of Zeta have been described by your witnesses as \u201cblues,\u201d \u201cbrowns,\u201d and \u201csilvers,\u201d all of which possess some human-like or dwarflike characteristics, and who represent a group of Zeta mutations created through their experiments in genetic engineering. The blue-skinned Zephelium are the administrator caste of the Zeta, governing all lower-ranking Zeta castes. The Zeta are a fragmented species and their customs and policies differ widely among the various groups. Aethian Often seen appearing with the Zeta (especially with the \u201cgreys,\u201d \u201cbrowns\u201d and \u201cblues\u201d) are the tall skeletal-like beings that upon closer inspection resemble in structure your earthly preying mantis insect. These beings are usually whitish or golden in color and can stand up to twelve feet tall. These beings are known in some circles as the Aethien. Aethien are not of the Zeta species but often work with them and assist humans in their encounters with the Zeta. They also work with those from other dimensional systems. The Aethien",
