Imagine that you can see light streaming in from a beam above you, as if there was a sun positioned above your consciousness. \u2022 Breathe light from that sun, into your consciousness and feel it make the pulsation rhythm of the thought-form and your consciousness move faster. See the dark area that is presently \u201cyou\u201d become more and more light filled. Begin to hear the sound pitch of the energy in the thought-form and hear its fre- quency raise, as more and more light enters the thought-form. Allow the sound and sensation of expanding light to fill your entire consciousness, and continue to draw light in, until you sense a distinct stop to the sensa- tion of light expanding. The thought-form has now reached its maximum holding capacity for UHF energy. \u2022 Now, imagine that the sun above you is moving down, into your consciousness and the thought-form. When the sun enters the thought-form, the thought- form explodes and the crystalline energy substance, of which its morpho- genetic field was made, literally blows apart. The thought-form no longer exists as a reality within your body or consciousness, its particles of energy substance have been released. The energetic reality of this process is that of using inner light (visualizations) to guide UHF sound patterns into a thought-form morpho",
