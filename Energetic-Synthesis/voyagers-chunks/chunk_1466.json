The Urtite- Cloister Mu\u2019a, Yu, Ur, Breanoua and Rama races, each with their respective DNA Template Star Gate Correlations, are the seed races from which con- temporary humanity emerged. Through this ancestral genetic affiliation, the humans of contemporary Earth also hold the DNA Template Star Gate Correlations inherited through the particular Palaidia Empire race from which their original genetic ancestry emerged. Though we have presently lost memory of our greater purpose within the Planetary Christos Realign- ment Mission, our current human races are as important as the Palaidia Empire races, in fulfillment of the Founders\u2019 Planetary, Galactic and Univer- sal Rehabilitation plan. The Cycle of the Rounds, through which human evolution was intended to bring about the Christos Realignment on Earth within a specific quadrant of time, is designed to occur in four phases, or four Rounds. The First Round of Seeding-3 Human evolution took place with seeding of the five 25-48 Strand DNA Template Palaidia Urtite-Cloister Maji races of the subterranean Palaidia Empires in 798,000 BC, and their subsequent emergence onto Earth\u2019s surface between",
