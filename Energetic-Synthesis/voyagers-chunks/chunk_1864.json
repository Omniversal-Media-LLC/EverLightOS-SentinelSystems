Full clearing of the Jehovian Seals 1-2-3 frequencies must be accomplished before the coming activation of Organic Seal-8, with its Jehovian Seal-4 companion, 6 if ampli fied climatic/tectonic disturbances are to be averted. Organic Seal-8/Jehovian Seal-4 will activate in early January 2002. 7 Much to UIR irritation, We're still standin\u2019, with even greater strength of spirit and personal resolve than before, despite their attempts at Psychotronic antagonism of Emerald Covenant groups. It became quite apparent, in reviewing the events of the evening of September 3, that the Eieyani were quite serious when they had earlier that day explained that the UIR was now taking aggressive steps to rapidly advance their OWO agenda. Just how aggressive these steps would be did not become apparent until the morning of September 11, 2001. When Jehovian Seals release, their frequencies can create disruptions for up to a 1000-2000 mile perimeter surrounding the Seal\u2019s placement, while the greatest degree of climatic or tectonic disruption occurs in the location of the Seal and within 100-200 miles of its epicenter. The Seven Jehovian Seals are located at different horizontal Ley Line/ Latitude coordinates along the common vertical Axiatonal Line-7 at 70\u00b0 W Longitude, which runs down the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
