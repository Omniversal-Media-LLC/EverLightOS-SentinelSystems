  "text": "all abduction episodes contain this particular feature, but many do). And it is here that many abductees become confused as to whether their experiences were \u201creally real\u201d physical events or whether they were mental events, hallucinations, dreams or excursions into the \u201castral plane.\u201d The reality of what is occurring is that the energy field of the mind and that of the cellular pattern of the flesh are being put on \u201cdifferent speeds\u201d (different rates of vibrational oscillation). The mind- field is accelerated, its rate of oscillation increased, which creates the sense data of the lessening of density. Meanwhile the energetic field of the molecular structure is decelerated, its rate of oscillation slowed, creating the bodily-sensed data of an increase in density. The oscillation rates of both of these energy fields are held within a certain interval or within a particular ratio, which temporarily disengages the connection between them. The mental awareness and the body consciousness thus are split, placed within two separate frequency bands. The mind is held at a frequency higher than that of the third dimension\u2014its oscillation rate is increased. While the mind is accelerated and tuned into a higher frequency pattern, the body is decelerated, its oscillation rate slowed, tuning it to a lower frequency. In greater terms this maneuver constitutes moving the mental awareness into t",
