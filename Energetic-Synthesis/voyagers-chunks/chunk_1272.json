Earth\u2019s Sixth Vortex\u2014Caucasus Mountains, Russia \u2014Opens. Earth Completes D-5 Pleiadian Activation and Begins D-6 Sirian Activation. The Sphere of Amenti Begins Transmitting D-6 Frequency through Earth\u2019s Grid. Earth Completes Shift into HU-2 Time Cycles. The Sphere of Amenti will complete its opening of D-5 frequencies into Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field, the fifth primary vortex in Peru will be fully opened and activated, and the natural seal on the sixth primary vortex will open. Earth\u2019s sixth primary vortex is located in the Caucasus Moun- tains in Russia. The Sphere of Amenti begins transmitting D-6 frequency through Earth\u2019s grid, as the D-6 Sirian Spiral aligns with the D-5 Alcyone Spiral. Earth completes its D-5 Pleiadian Activation that began in 6/2004 and begins its D-6 Sirian Activation. At the end of its Pleiadian Activation on 6/2008, Earth completes its \ufb01nal 2/3 shift into the HU-2 time cycles, in preparation for the merger of the grids of Earth and Tara on 5/5/2012 . The morphogenetic wave continues to build as Tara\u2019s D-4 and D-5 particles begin to merge with Gaia\u2019s D-7 and D-8 anti-particles, and Tara\u2019s D-4 and D-5 Merkaba Fields begin to merge with Gaia\u2019s D-7 and D-8 Merkaba Fields. Tara\u2019s D-4 and D-5 particle base moves into the",
