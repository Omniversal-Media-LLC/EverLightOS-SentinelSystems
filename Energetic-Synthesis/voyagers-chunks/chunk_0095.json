  "text": "t records exist in physical form as a set of 12 Silver-metallic discs called the Cloister-Dora-Teura-Plate Libraries or \u201cCDT-Plates.\u201d The 12 CDT-Plates are holographic recording, storage and transmission devices that hold massive amounts of data in encrypted, electromagnetic scalar-standing-wave form. Translation of data from the CDT-Plate Libraries is accomplished through initiation of specific frequency transmissions, through which the discs activate to release their stored data in the chosen form of holographic, audio, visual or digital translation. The 12 CDT-Plates were manufactured from a form of striated-selenite-quartz crystal organic to the Density-2 planet Sirius B, surrounding a radioactive isotopic core, encased in a \u201chybrid-metal\u201d silver-alloy compound organic to Earth. The CDT-Plates were manufactured by the Taran Priests of Ur and Maharaji Sirian-Blue Human \u201cHoly Grail Line\u201d races of the Council of Azurline, often collectively called the \u201cAzurite\u201d or \u201cEieyani\u201d Races, on Density-2 Sirius B, GA Signet Council-6 and guardians of D- 6 Sirius B Star Gate-6 in the Universal Templar Complex (see: Voyagers, Vol. 1). In 246,000 BC, CDT-Plates were presented as a gift",
