From this D-1 position, Earth would have to evolve through another 26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle in HU-1, before having another opportu- nity to ascend to HU-2. As you can perhaps now see, it is very important that the Sphere of Amenti is appropriately placed in Earth\u2019s core, and the Blue Flame success- fully embodies, during the half-point in the second ascension cycle. If this process does not occur, the Earth becomes trapped in HU-1 time. This digres- sion and repetition of HU-1 time cycles has occurred seven times in the past of Earth\u2019s evolution. Earth is presently within its eighth repetition of the 26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle in HU-1. Earth\u2019 s evolution has been stunted within the HU-1 time cycle for nearly 212,448 years. Though some progress was made in dimensional ascension at several different points in time, Earth and 120",
