Those whites born of egg donation and non-biological insemination, who cannot usually endure interdimensional transport are known as the Borentasai (bor en' thas i). Both hybrid strains are highly intelligent, with a strong mathematical leaning and great ability to comprehend the workings of universal physics and advanced sciences built upon that comprehension. Both represent pure strains of Human-Zeta hybrids, those two races being the only contributors to their genetic makeup. Their base strain was formulated out of the genetic materials of the \u201clittle grey\u201d Zeta and the human genetic imprint, used in various combinations. (Other Zeta- human hybrid strains utilizing the Zephelium-Zeta genetic code are presently being constructed.) Both strains of the Borendt (bor en'), (as they are called collectively), have the ability to link minds directly with human contactees, using the aforementioned Keylonta Codes. They are thus able to interact with humans during the human dream state or during times of altered states of consciousness, such as those that occur when practicing certain meditation techniques. Often they will leave \u201cpre- recorded\u201d imprints, packages of communicated data in electrical form,",
