The Palaidorian Cloister races left no remnants in your present world, for they evolved within the faster moving time bands of Earth, within the anti-particle universe. The morphogenetic fields of those races were then drawn into your particle-Earth and out of these came the next evolutionary stage. The First and Second Etheric Root Races of Gaia Rescue Mission Stage 2 25,000,000-20,000,000 YA Before manifestation into embodiment on your Earth the five Cloistered races divided into two groups. One group held the DNA imprint for 1/2 of the first strand of DNA (which corresponded to dimension-one frequencies), the other group held the remaining 1/2 of the first strand. This created polar- ization and gender within the Cloistered Race morphogenetic field. Both groups held the dimensional codes/strands of 7-12. These two groups were seeded on Gaia, the seventh-dimensional/HU-3 counterpart to Tara and Earth. These two races were the first two Root Races, the Polarians of Gaia and the Hyperborneans of Gaia\u2019s antiparticle double.
