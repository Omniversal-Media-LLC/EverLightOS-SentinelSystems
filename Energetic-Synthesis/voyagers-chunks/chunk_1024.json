Particles in the D-3.5 vibration spin at a 22.5\u00b0 reverse angular rotation to the particles in D-3 (Earth\u2019s atmosphere) and at a 22.5\u00b0 angular rotation to the particles in D-4. (D-4 particles spin at a 45\u00b0 reverse angular rotation to D-3 particles). The gold core crystal of Tara-Earth\u2019s D-4 Merkaba Field appears as a Sun to those of the Inner Earth. This D-3.5 area is called the Inner Earth because one must travel through the Earth\u2019s external portals, downward through the Earth into the D-2 Earth morphoge- netic field, then into the D-1 iron core crystal in the center of Earth (which in reality exists inside of the sphere of the Sun) in order to re-emerge within the D-3.5 frequency level of the Sun where Agartha exists. Just as the gold core crystal of Tara-Earth\u2019s D-4 Merkaba Field appears as a Sun when viewed from Agartha at the 3.5-frequency level, the iron core crystal of Earth\u2019s D-1 Merkaba Field appears as Earth\u2019s Sun when viewed from the D-3 frequency level.\u00b9 What you perceive as the Sun actually represents the iron core crystal D-1 Merkaba Fields of the 11 planets plus the Sun in your local solar system. Though the planets and Sun appear to be externalized from the Earth, in reality, the sub- stance of the Earth and the local planets exists within the energetic substance of what you perceive as the Sun.
