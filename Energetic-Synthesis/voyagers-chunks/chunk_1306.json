In D-4, where the particle pulsation rhythm is twice as fast as that of D-3, 2213 years repre- sents one full D-4 time cycle\u2014 a 45\u00b0 shift in angular rotation of particle spin = 2213 years in D-4. A 22.5\u00b0 shift of angular rotation of particle spin in D-4 represents 1106.5 years. The D-4 22.5\u00b0 reverse shift in angular rota- tion of particle spin, which is used to create the Bridge Zone shift, trans- lates into a minus 1106.5 years. In raising the accretion level of Earth from 2.5 to 3.5, Earth omits 2213 years from its D-3 time track and 1106.5 years from its D-4 time track, for a total forward leap of 3319.5 years. However, the angular rotation of Earth\u2019s particle spin will be shifted 22.5\u00b0 in reverse within the D-4 cycle, in order to enter the Bridge Zone, creating a minus 1106.5 years. In entering the Bridge Zone continuum, Earth moves ahead 3319.5 years, then back 1106.5 years, in terms of time-space placement, for a total forward time gain of 2213 years, or half of a D-3 cycle (3319.5- 1106.5=2213 years). \u00b2 Following the three-day particle conversion period, which will occur sometime between 5/5/2017 and 6/30/2017, as the Bridge Zone Earth takes its position 2213 years in the future at accretion level 3.5, the phantom Earth becomes a",
