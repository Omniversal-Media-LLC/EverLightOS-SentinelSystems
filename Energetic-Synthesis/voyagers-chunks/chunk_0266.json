  "text": "from the tree upon which it grows, not only will the branch wither and die, but so will the buds and leaves that depended upon that branch to transport nourishment and life force energy from the tree. There is an intimate connection between the time portal system and the genetic code of all life forms within it. When the time portals are damaged the genetic imprint of biological life is altered, mutated from its original pattern. When the Zeta disengaged their time portals from the main grid of the Time Matrix it caused their mutation. Their biology no longer carries the appropriate codes to allow them to link into their Source. They lost the ability to experience emotion to a large degree, and the emotional facility can be compared to the branch systems of our tree. The Zeta are able to draw energy from their souls, but their souls can no longer draw energy from the Time Matrix, Energy Matrix or Source. Once the leaves fall the bud can no longer renew itself if it cannot draw energy from the tree. The Zeta are as leaves and buds stunted upon a withering branch that has been severed from the tree. A dying race unless they are able to once again mutate their biological strain into the Time Matrix and the Energy Matrix System. Through genetics they are attempting to create what could be compared to a \u201csplice,\u201d taking their fallen branch and reintroducing it to another tree in hop",
