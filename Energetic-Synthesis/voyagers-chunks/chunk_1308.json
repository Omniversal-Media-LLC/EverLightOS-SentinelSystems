People with less DNA strand assembly, and an accretion level of less than 4.5 will shift back to the D-3 time continuum when Earth leaves the D-4 continuum following the three-day period. In previous sec- tions, we have discussed the experiential perceptions one will encounter within each of the three tracks of time, and what one might expect to experience through this transition period, so we will not restate that infor- mation here. During this 3-day period, when the Meta-galactic portals open, people who have fully assembled and activated the sixth DNA strand can ascend directly out of matter into etheric matter on Gaia, and those who have activated the eighth strand can ascend directly through the Meta-galactic Core into pure morphogenetic consciousness in dimensions 9-12. During the three-day period of full alignment with the Holographic Beam, a burst of accelerating energy runs through Earth\u2019 s grid, allowing many others to almost instantaneously assemble the \ufb01fth or sixth strands, giving them a \ufb01nal opportunity to ascend to Tara or Gaia. Orion, Arcturian and Andromeda Stellar Activations take place in this 3- day period. 38. July 2017: Planetary Cores of Earth, Tara, Gaia, Meta-galac",
