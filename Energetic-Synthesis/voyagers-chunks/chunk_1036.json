Normally, when the grids of Tara and Earth begin to enter alignment with each other about five years before the half-cycle point, the D-1 and D-4 Merkaba Fields line up as follows: Earth\u2019s electrical overtone spiral in D-1 aligns with Tara\u2019s base tone mag- netic spiral in D-4, and Earth\u2019s magnetic base tone spiral in D-1 aligns with Tara\u2019s electrical overtone spiral in D-4. This alignment of D-1 electrical to D-4 magnetic and D-1 magnetic to D-4 electrical creates an interdimensional Resonant Tone through which the planetary grids can fuse. Following the reversal of Tara\u2019s D-4 and Earth\u2019s D-1 Merkaba Fields, the new alignment between Earth\u2019s and Tara\u2019s Merkaba Fields became D-1 electrical to D-4 electrical and D-1 magnetic to D-4 mag- netic. The particles, which compose the planetary grids, would magnetically repel each other and the grids of Earth and Tara could not fuse. But this plan also causes major imbalance within the D-2, D-3, D-5 and D-6 Merkaba Fields. If the Sirian Council and other Guardian groups had not intervened, the human populations of Earth would have been vaporized between 1972-1974. By 1950 Earth scientists began to notice odd phenomena occurring on the",
