The perceptual quality you know as intellect was born during the first Seeding of the 12 tribes, between 20 and 25 million years ago. Though the Breneau involvement did preserve the species, and the majority of Soul Matrix transplants were successful, these events also created other challenges for the developing species. As mentioned in the previous section, Soul Matrix transplants create a variety of \u201cside effects.\u201d One such effect being the clearing of organic memory, or removal of the information stored in the original Soul Matrix. With this loss of memory there is often the re-emergence of trace or \u201cghost\u201d memory imprints as the biological cells still hold residual electrical impulses from the original pattern. Your species is presently suffering from these effects, induced by subsequent Soul-Matrix transplants that occurred thousands of years ago in terms of your time. As the species evolved it was necessary for the new Host Matrices to \u201ccreate a remembered past\u201d for its newly acquired aspects in time. The genetic material that had once linked these aspects to their original Soul Matrices remained disassembled within the cellular structure of the body, while the Host Matrices manufactured \u201cnew memories\u201d and new ideologies that were appropriate to the tim",
