They are orchestrated in a straight- forward manner, transmutation and alteration of form through the process of transmigration. Not all abductions are clear-cut. Clear-cut manipulations are carried out upon those who possess a biological organism that can withstand the rigors of transmigration. Most of your population, at the present time, cannot biologically endure such manipulation. Some abduction cases involve partial use of transmigration in combination with tactics of perceptual interference, whereby holographic inserts (as described in previous sections) are used to \u201ccloak\u201d the abductee\u2019s perception of the abduction event prior to the \u201csplitting\u201d of awareness and transmigration. In these cases you will often find \u201ccover memories\u201d that will emerge in place of or in conjunction with actual memories of the abduction event. Abductees may remember seeing wolves, owls, or humans instead of \u201caliens and spaceships.\u201d The emotional reaction to these cover images will seem out of place, however, over-reactive to the seeming content. This is a clue to the possible application of cover memories and holographic inserts. This tactic is most often used to distract the subject long enough to instigate the spli",
