(Wake up guys\u2014you\u2019ve been taken for a ride!).The people involved with the Labyrinth Group and associated organizations have been convinced by the Nephilim \u201cCorteum,\u201d (they don\u2019t even know they are Nephilim) that only by developing the Corteum\u2019s \u201cBeaST\u201d can Earth be protected from ET invasion. The Labyrinth Group was told that a \u201cbig, bad invader race\u201d 9 is planning to invade Earth in 2011 and that the Corteum \u201cBST weapon\u201d is the only way to prevent this invasion. The UIR Corteum need the Labyrinth Group to create this technology for them, as the Corteum cannot access the earthly scientific facilities, resources or geographical positions needed to assemble the tactile components of the BeaST weapon. It is the Corteum themselves, and their recent allies of the UIR, that are intending to invade in 2011; their rebel Omicron-Drakonian adversaries are intending a counter-invasion in hope of preve nting UIR/Corteum victory. The \u201cWingmakers Ancient Arrow\u201d archeological site does not belong to the Lab- yrinth Group, or to the Corteum. It belongs to a group of Emerald Covenant Angelic Human Races from the Interdimensional Association of Free Worlds in the 6520 AD time period and to the Elohei-Elohim Founders, who long ago buried \u201ctime capsule trea- sures\u201d in this region specifically for discovery in this time. 10 The Elohei-Elohim have approached the Labyrinth Group with invitation",
