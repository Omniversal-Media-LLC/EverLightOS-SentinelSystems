Within the 15-dimensional Unified Field, the morphogenetic field cre- ates structures of multidimensional electromagnetic energy, around and through which the matter form will manifest. These multidimensional EM fields are collectively referred to as the bio-energetic system or the auric field of a manifest form. All manifest forms possess a bio-energetic system/auric field. The auric field has seven primary, inner layers through which physical manifestation takes place and which correspond to dimensional frequency bands 1 through 7. The auric field also has seven outer layers, which repre- sent the form-holding morphogenetic imprints for the seven inner layers of the auric field. The seven outer layers correspond to dimensional frequency bands 9 through 15. The 14 layers of the auric field are connected to each other through a central point within the eighth dimension Meta-galactic Core. This center point represents the point through which a form\u2019s original morphogenetic imprint was entered into the 15-dimensional system. All forms and beings are thus indelibly connected to each other and the universe through interwoven morphogenetic fields that are united through the D-8 center point. Energy moves from the seven outer morphogenetic lay- ers of the auric field, through the seven inner layers and into manifestation within dimensions 1-7, through the structure of dimensio",
