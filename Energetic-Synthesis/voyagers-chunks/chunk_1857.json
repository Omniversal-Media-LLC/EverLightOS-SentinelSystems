  "text": "Conclusion\u2014 Earth Changes Potential The unnatural Seven Jehovian Seals are a despicable atrocity of technological ''achievement.'' Since 10,500 BC, the implanted crystalline rods of the Jehovian Seals have lain dormant in Earth\u2019s crust and mantle like hidden \u201cmissiles,\u201d designed to progressively rip Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields apart as Earth\u2019s 12 natural Seals proceed through their opening cycle during the 2000-2017 SAC. Each Jehovian Seal \u201copens\u201d and begins activating its frequencies in Earth's Templar when its corresponding Organic Seal enters its activation cycle in response to Earth\u2019s particle pulsation (vibration/ oscillation) rhythm. The chaotically arranged, unnatural frequencies of the Jehovian Seal (the \u201crider\u201d or \u201cHorseman\u201d) bond to the natural frequencies transmitted by the Organic Star Crystal Seal (the \u201cHorse\u201d). The \u201crider\u201d frequency silently moves with the natural frequency current into the Axiatonal and Ley Line (ALL) system corresponding to the Organic Seal, progressively reversing the natural Angular-Rotation-of Particle-Spin (ARPS, the particle spin axis) within the frequencies of electromagnetic energy moving through the ALLs. As the currents of frequency moving through the ALL system progressively reverse to the unnatural ARPS of the Phantom Matrix, the corresponding portions of Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields are drawn into electromagnetic bonding with the D-7 Phan",
