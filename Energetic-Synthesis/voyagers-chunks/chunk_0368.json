To create mass holographic inserts the Zeta have to create a frequency fence (by manipulating the Keylonta Codes within the human DNA using sound) that \u201cblocks out\u201d the higher and lower frequency bands, \u201csealing in\u201d the human perceptual range to the frequency bands used in the insert, thus disengaging the individual\u2019s ability to translate Soul Matrix data through the body and into conscious awareness. The development of HSP is part of the human evolutionary path, and the body's ability to process the higher frequency information is just emerging into your species on a mass level. Certain Keylonta Codes must be activated by energy impulsed from the Soul Matrix to set in motion the latent codes (within the \u201cjunk DNA\u201d) that will direct the body (through its electrical, chemical and hormonal structures) to translate the higher frequency information. Until these latent codes are activated the higher and lower frequency energy will simply \u201cfall through the gaps\u201d within the nerve synapses. The electrical, chemical and hormonal changes created by the latent code activations literally add new \u201cimpulse receivers\u201d to the neurological structure and strengthen the nerve fibers to be able to carry a \u201clarger load\u201d of electrical impulse. Without these alterations the human body cannot translate frequency that is outside its translational range. To increase perceptual range t",
