Much later the Kantarians founded the Kantarian Federation, gaining approval from the HU-1 Galactic Federa- tion to serve as a guardian and educator race for Earth humans of the Second and Third Seedings and they became heavily involved with old Sumerian and Egyptian cultures, as well as that of Atlania and Atlantis. The portal bridge between Sirius B, the Sphere of Amenti and Earth allowed for greater evolutionary options for the fourth and fifth races, those who carried the third DNA strand in their race morphogenetic field. This option was not available to Lamanian/Lemurian and Ur-Antrian cultures, as they did not carry the full third stand imprint in their morphogenetic field. The option assisted Atlanian/Atlantean races and their Breanoua Cloister who suc- cessfully assembled the third strand, and also the Aeiran/Aryan races and their Hibiru Cloister who were not able to fully assemble their fourth DNA strand prior to death. For these races, instead of the soul essence fragmenting into D-2, D-3 and D-4 following death (as would be the case due to the Seal of Palaidor), the soul essence who had assembled most of the third strand could move into the race morphogenetic field in Sirius B.
