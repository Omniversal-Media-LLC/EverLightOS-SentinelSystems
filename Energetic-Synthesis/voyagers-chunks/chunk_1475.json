From the present moment we CAN change the influence of the past, as well as re-define the future. The past is not changed by negating memory of its reality or by invalidating its apparent manifest existence. The \u201cpast\u201d, pro- jected from one present frequency pattern, must be acknowledged and incor- porated as part of the present frequency pattern (\u201cpast\u201d brought into the present moment of power). Once the remembered and evidential past is incorporated into the present moment, the entire frequency pattern in the present needs to be altered into vibrational co-resonance with the frequency pattern of the desired future manifestation. There are many complex elements to mastering the skill of projecting desired outcomes into our personal experiential future. Though each individ- ual does possess the inherent power to create desired manifest experience, this personal power is always tempered and directly influenced by the larger frequency-field of the Collective Consciousness. In like fashion, the mani- festation powers of both the personal and collective consciousness are directly regulated and influenced by the frequency-field of the Planetary Time Cont",
