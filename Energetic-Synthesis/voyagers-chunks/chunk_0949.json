The sacrifice of Arihabi was orchestrated to divert attention away from Jeshewua-9, his family and his lin- eage. The resurrection of the \u201cbody of Christ\"/Arihabi, was orchestrated by the Elohim through the use of holographic inserts, but Arihabi was indeed resur- rected following the holographic display.
