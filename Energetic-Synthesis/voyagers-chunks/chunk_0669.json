Tara became trapped in the tracks of time within the Second Harmonic Universe. The Fall to Harmonic Universe-1 and the 12 Planets 550,000,000 YA The fragments of the Taran planetary grid that became dismembered from Tara\u2019s core energy supply rapidly fell in vibration until they could no longer resist the natural magnetic pull of the descending lnterdimensional energy cur- rents. The planet fragments were pulled into a sun within Tara\u2019s universe, vaporized, and the morphogenetic field carried in those fragments was pulled into a black hole at the center of this sun\u00b9 and re-emerged into a galaxy within the lower-dimensional fields of Harmonic Universe 1. Entering this system as gaseous substance, this morphogenetic field broke down into 12 pieces, which set up a \u201cmini-solar system\u201d around a star within an already existing HU-1 solar system. One of the 12 pieces of Tara\u2019s fragmented morphogenetic field fused with this sun, while the 11 other pieces began to build up matter density and re-manifest their forms through their portion of the morphogenetic field. These planets did not birth into existence in the usual accretion fashion, for they car- ried with them the organizational imprint of part of Tara\u2019s planetary grid mor- phogentic field. Thes",
