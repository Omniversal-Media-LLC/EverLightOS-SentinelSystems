For those humans who are ready and able to receive such communications directly the Borendt are willing to begin sharing information and creating conscious relationships. They can be trusted, as you will not find the Borendt present with Zeta groups who are working in violation of the human species. On the rare occasions that Borendt accompany unenlightened Zeta, they are either held captive via mind control or work covertly as guardian infiltrates, in either case they hold pro-human sympathies at heart. The Borendt were created out of your lineage, and are aware of this fact, and so they view the human race with great compassion and a parental sense of responsibility. One day they will be welcomed and respected among those humans working toward universal brotherhood. The Borendt have much to teach your race, skills and knowledge that you need to make your evolution easier and more fulfilling, both for the individual and the masses. We would like you to understand that the Zeta are not \u201cevil monsters\u201d desiring to destroy or misuse humanity. Rather, they are a fragmented race, many of whom live in fear of extinction\u2014a race trying to create solutions for themselves using the only methods they possess. As is the case within the human species",
