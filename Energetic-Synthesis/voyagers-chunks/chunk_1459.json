Through the Temporary D-12 Christos Grid formed on Earth by the presence of the Maji Races, a quantity of D-12 fre- quency could be re-introduced into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields during every natural SAC. Through this progressive re-introduction of D-12 frequency into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields, the portions of Earth\u2019s Axiatonal Line and Ley Line systems that had been damaged in the 549,998,000 BC cata- clysm of Tara (see Page 2), could be progressively realigned with the Shield of Aramatena Christos Blueprint. The physical bodies of the Maji Races served as literal conduits of electromagnetic energy, through which the D- 12 Shield of Aramatena frequencies could be held on planet for progressive planetary grid repair , until Earth\u2019s grids were repaired sufficiently to hold the natural, permanent D-12 Christos Realignment. Originally, all species on Earth were seeded to serve as conduits of frequency through which the Founders D-12 Christos Realignment could be progressively fulfilled in the Earth-Tara-Gaia system. The damage Earth\u2019s grids incurred through the Taran cataclysm made Earth\u2019s Templar Complex unable to naturally with- stand participation in a SAC. The Earth-Tara-Gaia system would have been a Phantom Planet system (see page 1",
