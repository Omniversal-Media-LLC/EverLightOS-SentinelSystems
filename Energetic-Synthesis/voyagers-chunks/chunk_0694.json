Once a HU-1 planet pulled in its portion of the higher dimensional frequencies, it would then undergo dimensional ascension back into Tara's grid, bringing with it its por- tion of the Taran morphogenetic field. Tara could not ascend to HU-3 and become Gaia until each of its HU-1 planets completed the manifestation of their portion of the morphogenetic field and ascended back into the Taran grid. (The time when this will occur is many millions of years in your future). But each planet in your solar system has its part to play in this program. Each planet received its portion of the Taran morphogenetic field. Earth received its portion 25 million years ago when the Halls of Amenti were con- structed.\u00b2 The five Cloistered Races of the Sphere of Amenti retrieved their frequency pattern 25 million years ago. This pattern of energy/morphoge- netic field had the appearance of a standing wave pattern, composed of fourth- and fifth-dimensional frequencies, and thus appearing as blue in color. Visually, this standing wave pattern looks like an electric-blue \ufb02ame with a pale shade of green, several inches in height. The blue \ufb02ame, which consti- tutes Earth's portion of Tara's morphogenetic field, was brought into the Sphere of Amenti b",
