The Guardians inter- vened directly to avert the pending destruction of Earth and the Pleiadian Star system that would otherwise have taken place in 2976 AD due to Dracos- Zeta Resistance infiltration. Originally the Guardians planned only to assist in stimulating the Earth\u2019s core and aligning Earth\u2019s Merkaba Fields to receive the Stellar Spirals during the ascension period.

Because of the Guardians efforts, Earth is now prepared to receive its first Stellar Activation on 5/5/2000.
