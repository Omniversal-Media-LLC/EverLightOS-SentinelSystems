  "text": "Time Shift At present, Earth\u2019s D-2 elemental body is at 1.5 accretion and its D-1 particle base is at .5 accretion. Agartha\u2019s atmosphere is at 3.5 accretion, its elemental body at 2.5, thus Agartha\u2019s elemental body is located within Earth\u2019s atmosphere at a different angular rotation of particle spin than that of Earth\u2019s particles, and so appears invisible. Agartha\u2019s particle base is at 1.5 accretion, thus Agartha\u2019s particle base is located within Earth\u2019s elemental body. During the Bridge Zone transition, when Earth\u2019s atmosphere is shifted from 2.5 accretion to 3.5 accretion, it will be merged with the atmosphere of Agartha. Earth\u2019s elemental body will shift from 1.5 accretion to 2.5 accre- tion, Earth\u2019s elemental kingdom will merge with that of Agartha. Earth's par- ticle base will shift from .5 accretion to 1.5 accretion, Earth\u2019s particle base will merge with Agartha\u2019s particle base. When Earth merges with Tara\u2019s grid in the D-4 time cycle between 2012 and 2017, the Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field temporarily reaches a height of accretion level 4, then returns to its nat- ural 2.5-accretion level following 2017. In the Bridge Zone Project, Earth\u2019s morphogenetic content will peak at accretion level 4 when merging with Tara\u2019s grid between 2012-2017, then instead of returning to its natural 2.5-accretion level/D-3 time cycle after 2017, Earth will return to the 3.5-accretion level.
