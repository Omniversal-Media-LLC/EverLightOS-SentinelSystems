From these positions in time, the ships could enter the D-2 frequency bands of Earth and begin transmitting EM pulses through the Earth\u2019s grid, which would serve to reconstruct their Frequency Fence and cause mutation in the fourth DNA strand. Even if the grids of Earth and Tara were able to merge between 2012-2017, the human gene code would not have time to fully assemble the fifth DNA strand in the majority of the populations. This would stop the scheduled ascen- sions through the Halls of Amenti and keep the Zeta Seal operational within the Sphere of Amenti, so their human captives in D-4 would once again be subject to Zeta-Dracos control. For their new plan to work, the Zetas had to begin broadcasting their EM pulse Frequency Fence as close to 2012 as possible, while still allowing enough time for the fence to take effect within the human gene code. It would take a minimum of six years for the new frequency fence to cause the fourth DNA strand mutation in the majority of the human popula- tions, so the Dracos-Zeta Resistance would have to begin broadcasting their EM pulses no later than 2006. If they began broadcasting too soon, the Guard- ians\u2019 infusions of D-4 frequency would counteract their EM transmissions, a",
