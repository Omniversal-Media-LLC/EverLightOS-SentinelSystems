The por- tions of the Egyptian sub-race that remained in the Amenti morphogenetic field were fused with the morphogenetic field provided by the HU-2 Seres, which created a hybrid Egyptian race called the Serres, who became the Pharaonic line within Egyptian culture. The Serres-Egyptians began a new line of Egyptian bearing an advanced genetic strain. Later, during the Third Seeding, the Egyptians carrying Sirian-Anunnaki- Nephilim morphogenetic fields were remixed with the Serres-Egyptians so the morphogenetic field of the Sirian-Egyptians could be integrated into the Sphere of Amenti. Descendants of the Serres-Egyptians held the line of Egyp- tian royalty throughout the early dynasties, but eventually the Sirian-Egyptians were integrated into this line and, for a time, open relationships with the Sir- ian-Anunnaki and Sirian Blue Races resumed. The Egyptians carried a special- ized genetic code because of this early morphogenetic manipulation. During the Third Seeding this imprint became even more",
