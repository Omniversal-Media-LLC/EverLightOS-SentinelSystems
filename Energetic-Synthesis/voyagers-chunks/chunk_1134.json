The 3.5-accretion level represents the time cycle between D-3 and D-4, in which Agartha\u2019s reality takes place. In the usual process, Earth\u2019s particles would undergo a 45\u00b0 shift in angular rotation of particle spin to enter the D-4 cycle, then shift back 45\u00b0 to return to the D-3 time cycle. In the Bridge Zone, Earth will undergo the 45\u00b0 shift of angular rotation of particle spin to merge with Tara. Instead of shifting back 45\u00b0 to return to the D-3 time cycle, Earth\u2019s particles will shift back only 22.5\u00b0, placing Earth within the 3.5-accretion level, the time cycle between D-3 and D-4, merging Earth and Agartha. Earth will become the Inner Earth, Agar- tha, through the 2012-2017 transition. Humans who have assembled all of the fourth DNA strand and half of the fifth will perceive this transition as the emergence of new lands and struc- tures on Earth, and the literal disappearance of some of the existing Earth structures. Humans who do not assemble these strands will perceive a differ- ent reality entirely. During this transition, the particles of Earth that are unable to fully shift into the faster pulsation rate, those that cannot re",
