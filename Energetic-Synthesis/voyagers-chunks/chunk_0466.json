It is as if the singular alphabet can be used to create \u201cwords and sentences\u201d in French, English, German and Spanish (as an analogy in our example) all at once, each sentence conveying meaning to the \u201cpeople\u201d (or parts of the organism) that happen to speak that particular language. In the case of human biology, each of your five known \u201csenses\u201d13 would represent a collective that speaks one of those languages. All of the senses use the same Fire-Letter alphabet, or fixed electromagnetic impulse patterns, but each sense translates into meaning only the \u201csentences\u201d (strings or sequences of electromagnetic impulse patterns) that use its natural language. As the biology receives these electromagnetic \u201cmeanings\u201d each sense then further translates that meaning into other language forms that the conscious human mind can comprehend. In this way the sense data of your perceptual experience is brought into your conscious awareness. The senses serve as \u201clanguage translators,\u201d translating the sentences from their \u201cnative tongue\u201d (the original electromagnetic impulse sequences that were picked u",
