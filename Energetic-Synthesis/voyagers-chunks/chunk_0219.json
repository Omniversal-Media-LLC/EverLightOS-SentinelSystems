  "text": "Some abductees will begin to remember the soul agreements they had made and center the rest of their lives around fulfilling those agreements. In the abductions that involved violation of the human subject there is usually great fear, anger and a feeling of helplessness on the part of the abductee. Many such abductees will never have recall of their abduction experience, but may manifest psychological or emotional difficulties as the intrusion has registered on a subconscious level. Others will find recall and will be faced with trying to find a perspective on what they have experienced. Very little support exists for people who suffer this type of trauma. If they turn toward the government or authorities for answers and assistance they most often find their character attacked and their encounter invalidated. The medical and psychiatric professions presently offer little help to such people, as a general rule, because the possibility of the experience being valid does not fit into their belief paradigm. As more and more abduction cases come into public awareness and more abductees speak out about the encounters, a greater support network is emerging. (The Interior Government will resist this movement at every turn.) The most terrifying aspect of alien abduction for both groups of abductees is that no one seems to have any answers.
