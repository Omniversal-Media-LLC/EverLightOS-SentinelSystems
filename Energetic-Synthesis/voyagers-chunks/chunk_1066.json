The Guard- ians\u2019 primary concern at this time was to realign Earth\u2019s Merkaba Fields and bring Giza into alignment with Alcyone. They would ensure that the descent of the Sphere of Amenti and the Blue Flame stayed on schedule. Guardians were to maintain planetary balance while Earth\u2019s seven vortex seals opened, and they would begin making subtle contact with humans, to help them pre- pare for the opening of the Halls of Amenti. Following the 1943 Philadelphia Experiment, the Zetas\u2019 manipulation of the solar Merkaba Fields and the necessity of the Guardians\u2019 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence of 1972, the Guardians\u2019 preparation plan and deadline schedule became more taxing. Before the original plan could continue, the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence, which blocked all of the fourth-dimensional frequencies except the 12th base tone and overtone out of Earth\u2019s grid, had to be dismantled. Though the Guardians could alter the Frequency Fence enough to allow the Sphere of Amenti to enter Earth's core on schedule, the fence could not remain intact when the Sphere of Amenti began transmit- ting D-4 frequency into Earth\u2019s grid in 1/2000, when the fourth vortex seal opened. lt would take about four years for the Earth\u2019s grid to balance once the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence was released, so the fence had to be dow",
