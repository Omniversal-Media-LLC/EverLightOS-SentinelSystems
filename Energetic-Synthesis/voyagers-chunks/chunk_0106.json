The Templar Mechanics books of John the Baptist were not completed, as he was murdered prior to completion of CDT-Plate translation. The books of Enoch, Jesheua and Miriam represent 12 of the 15 \u201cMissing Books of the Bible\u201d that were originally part of the legitimate Essene \u201cGrail Line\u201d teachings.

The Cathari of Southern France held some of the original Essene records of Jesheua and Miriam until the Church of Rome ordered extermination of the Cathari in 1244 AD. Before their demise, the Cathari hid portions of the genuine Essene records, along with one of the 12 Signet Shields that had been in their possession. These relics will be eventually discovered in contemporary times to validate the teachings of the three CDT-Plate Speakers of present times, once these individuals have completed their current commissioned translation of the CDT-Plates.
