Since 1998 Emerald Covenant nations have used their limited access to NET transmission lines to begin \u201c poking holes\u201d in the NET. They are now progressively working to dissolve the NET through progressive 12-Code Pulse re-programming of the 24 Nibiruian Crystal Temple Network bases through which the frequencies of the NET are anchored into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields. Over the last 100 years, Anunnaki races have been using the NET to transmit specific technological information to strategically positioned, selected Illuminati Sleepers, through which \u201cHuman science\u201d could \u201cslowly advance\u201d via covert Anunnaki \u201cinspiration.\u201d Since 1943 the Zeta-Dracos have been running a counter \u201cET technology training program\u201d on Earth in hopes of capturing full control of the Anunnaki NET for use in their own agendas.
