  "text": "Ascension Cycle Dynamics the molecular and bio-energetic structure of Earth during the 2000-2017 AD Stellar Activation cycle are unprecedented in recorded human history. The first Stellar Activation begins as a result of Earth\u2019s core pulsation rhythm reaching a sufficient rate of speed to link with the first aligning Stel- lar Spiral. Stellar Wave Infusions begin after the onset of the first Stellar Activation. Halfway through the first Stellar Activation, the first Stellar Wave Infusion begins. Through the Infusion, the frequency bands of the next Stellar Activation are entered into the personal morphogenetic fields of humans and the morphogenetic field of Earth\u2019s core, while the first Activa- tion is still underway. When the first Stellar Activation is complete, all frequency bands associ- ated with it have been released from the Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field and are transmitting through Earth\u2019s grid. The next Stellar Activation begins as the frequency bands entered into the Earth's morphogenetic field during the first Stellar Wave Infusion cycle begin to transmit through Earth\u2019s grid. This sequence of Activation-Infusion-Activation continues through the six Stel- lar Activations, and each Activation has a Stellar Wave Infusion halfway through its activation cycle. The process operates within the human auric field, DNA and body in the same way that it occurs within the Earth\u2019s",
