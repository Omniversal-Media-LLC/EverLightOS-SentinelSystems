This re-vitalized Turane- usiam race became known as the Ur-Tarranates. The Ur-Tarranates created the Temple and Priesthood of Ur upon the continent of Mu. The Priesthood of Ur shared most practices of the Priests of Mu, but developed interest in more scientific applications of Spiritual Law (such as portal mechanics). Like the Priesthood of Mu, the Priests of Ur exist on Tara to this day, and they serve as Guardians and gatekeepers of the time portal structures that link Earth to present day Tara. During the Sirian Rebellion on Tara the Priesthood of Ur stood against the Templar Solar Initiates of Alania, eventually retreating underground with the people of Mu, unable to stop the Templars from misusing the power of the planetary core. Small wars within the local galactic sectors were fought during these times, which became known as the Taran Wars.
