In order to raise the grid speed, 8% of the total global population had to have the \ufb01fth strand activated, which meant that the Sphere of Amenti could not descend into Earth\u2019 s core until a concentration of Cloister Melchizedeks had been born. The second mass birthing wave of Melchizedek Cloister souls was scheduled to occur around 1500 BC, so the tentative date for the opening of the Halls of Amenti was set for a period following the 1500 BC Melchizedek Cloister birthing wave. The Sphere of Amenti was released from D-4 by the Elohim in 2409 BC. The seventh through 12th base tones of the third dimension, which had been removed from Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field to create the Frequency Fence, were readjusted. The eighth through 12th base tones of D-3 were re-entered into the Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field, reconstructing the Frequency Fence between the sixth and eighth base tones of the third dimension. This allowed the Sphere to enter into the UHF bands of D-3 until it was time to open the Halls of Amenti. Releasing the Sphere from the UHF bands of D-3 did not require synchronization with a natural dimensional blend period as would have been necessary if the Sphere remained in D-4. Following the Melchizedek birthing wave of 1500 BC, plans were made for the opening of the Halls of Amenti. This opportunity would also be used to begin the reintegrating of the An",
