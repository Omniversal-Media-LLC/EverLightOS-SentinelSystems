As a planet pulls in particles and patterns of frequency from the Unified Fields, its morphogenetic field progressively expands to include those fre- quency patterns and the pulsation rate of its particles progressively increases. For each dimensional band there is a corresponding specific rate of particle pulsation and also a specific angular rotation of particle spin. In one Har- monic Universe a planet simultaneously has three levels of energetic identity, one in each of the three-dimensional fields of that Harmonic Universe. The three levels of a planet\u2019s identity function together to give you the illusion of Earth\u2019s matter solidity. The particle content of each level of Earth\u2019s body pul- sates at a rhythm characteristic to the dimension in which each portion of the body is stationed, and particles spin on an angular rotation that is charac- teristic to the respective dimension. The planet exists within each of six time continua simultaneously, as each of the three levels of the planet\u2019s body pulls in energy from its respective dimensional band, through the synchroni- zation of particle pulsation speed and angular rotation of spin within each of the six time continua. A planet evolves out of one Harmonic Universe and into the next a",
