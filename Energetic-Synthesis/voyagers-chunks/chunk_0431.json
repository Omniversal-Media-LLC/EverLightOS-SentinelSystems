Look at the messages your mainstream reality and its hidden belief program are sending your citizens over and over: look at how you are programmed to create disease in your bodies and minds, because no one ever told you that you had the power to change the program and make better, healthier idea choices. No one ever told you that \u201cthoughts are things\u201d that create reality. The base program that people of your time have been subconsciously following has trained you to close your minds, and to fear, judge and condemn many of the ideas and technologies (such as those of intuitive development) that would heal you and set you free. We are simply asking you, for the sake of your evolution, to look at the program. And ask yourselves: Does it nurture human potential or does it limit its possibilities? Is it a humane program of ideas that begets brotherhood and harmony, or does it create separation, segregation and power struggle? Does it allow you to love and honor yourselves and others? Does it teach you respect for all life? It does not.",
