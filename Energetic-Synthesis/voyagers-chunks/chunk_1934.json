Energy moves from the seven outer morphogenetic lay- ers of the auric field, through the seven inner layers and into manifestation within dimensions 1-7, through the structure of dimensional Merkaba Fields (sets of counter-rotating, electromagnetic energy spirals). Each form has fif- teen dimensional Merkaba Fields, which hold its morphogenetic imprint intact within the 15-dimensional Unified Field. Through the rotation of the 15 Merkaba Fields, an energy structure in the form of an \u201cegg\u201d or capsule is formed within the dimensional Unified Field of each of the 15 dimensions. 464",
