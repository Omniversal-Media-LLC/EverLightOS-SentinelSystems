The Bridge Zone continuum omits 2213 years of the last half of the D-3 cycle and the \ufb01rst half of the D-4 cycle, which represents 1106.5 years. The D-4 cycle moves (has a particle pulsation rhythm) twice as fast as the D-3 continuum, which means that passage through the D-4 time contin- uum takes half as many years as it takes to pass through the D-3 contin- uum. In D-3, half of a continuum cycle represents 2213 years, so half of a D-4 cycle represents half of 2213 years, or 1106.5 years. Earth leaps ahead 2213 years by skipping the second half of its D-3 continuum cycle, and ahead another 1106.5 years by skipping the first half of its D-4 cycle. This creates a cumulative 3319.5-year leap ahead in space-time. This 3319.5- year leap does not include the time reversal acquired within the Bridge Zone. A 22.5\u00b0 reverse rotation of particle spin is used to shift Earth into the Bridge Zone continuum. One full D-3 cycle of 4426 years represents a cumulative 45\u00b0 shift in angu- lar rotation of particle spin, thus a 22.5\u00b0 shift in angular rotation of parti- cle spin in D-3 represents half D-3 cycle\u2014 2213 years. In D-4, where the particle pulsation rhythm is twice as fast as that of D-3, 2213 years repre- sents one fu",
