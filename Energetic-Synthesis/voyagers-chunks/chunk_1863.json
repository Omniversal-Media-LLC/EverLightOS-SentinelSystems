  "text": "Conclusion\u2014 Earth Changes Potential Despite the terribly disruptive energies of the Psychotronic sonic pulse that we experienced on the beach the night of September 3, the group managed to pull itself together and run the RRT as planned. The RRT was successful; through this group effort the GA was able to anchor a sufficient amount of D- 12 and higher frequency to bring the Organic Seal-4 current back into its natural ARPS. By September 10, the September 3 RRT frequencies reached critical mass in the Planetary Shields, returning the primary Organic Seal-4 frequencies back to their natural 12-Code\u2014Pulse. Jehovian Seals 1, 2 and 3 have, as of this writing, partially reverted back to the 12-Code-Pulse clearing , but still require some additional work before reaching their original state of 12-Code- Pulse conversion. This means that at least mild climatic disturbance effects from Jehovian Seals 1-3 are likely to occur between now and July 2002. Our groups will be working with the Emerald Covenant nations, running RRTs on several occasions between October and November 2001, to clear the remaining disruptive frequencies now running through Earth\u2019s grids from Jehovian Seals 1-3. Full clearing of the Jehovian Seals 1-2-3 frequencies must be accomplished before the coming activation of Organic Seal-8, with its Jehovian Seal-4 companion, 6 if ampli fied climatic/tectonic disturbances are",
