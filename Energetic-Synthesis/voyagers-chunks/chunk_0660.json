The Sirian Council from Harmonic Universe 2, along with several other groups were appointed as directors and overseers of the project, the Turaneusiam-1 (T-1) experiment. Metaterrestrials from the Fourth and Fifth Harmonic Universes were the founders of this project, working through a seed race called the Lyrans from the Third Harmonic Universe. The Lyrans created a race of beings in Harmonic Universe 3 called the Elohim, who would become overseers for the Sirian races in Harmonic universe 2.The Elohim became one of the numerous supervisory groups within the Turaneusiam-1 experiment, due to the Sirian race contribution of genetic identity to the experiment. The Turaneusiam race evolved for about eight million years on Tara, with 12 primary sub-racial divisions among them. Each of the 12 Turaneusiam sub- races carried a genetic slant derived from the 12 primary contributors to the T-1 experiment, but all of them carried the unique l2-strand DNA package the T-1\u2019",
