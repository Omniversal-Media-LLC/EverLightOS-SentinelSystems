The greater the amount of the 12-strand DNA imprint that can be activated within the body\u2019s DNA, the greater the amount of conscious aware- ness and multidimensional knowledge that will be available to the conscious- ness while it is physically embodied and after death. Through this knowledge, greater joy can be created while living on Earth, and following the death transition, the consciousness will be able to focus in higher dimensions of reality. In order to end the cycle of rebirth in HU-1, an identity must possess a fifth-dimensional level of consciousness, the particle substance of the consciousness must pulsate at the speed of fifth-dimensional frequency. The fifth strand of DNA must be fully assembled, and the lower- dimensional DNA strands must be fully activated and aligned. An identity that undergoes the death transition without assembly of the fifth DNA strand imprint will continue evolution in the fourth-dimensional astral planes. If that identity does not have the lower-dimensional strands fully assembled, it will have to experience rebirth in HU-1, in order to fully assemble the lower strand imprints. An identity that can fully assemble strands 1-5 while still within the body will be able to merge its molecular particles with those of its anti-particle double",
