One such event took place in the early 1900, which was repeated again in 1982. During both of these periods large asteroid masses came into alignment with Earth\u2019s orbit, and if they had not been destroyed or diverted in deep space by interdi- mensional Guardian \ufb02eets, before they entered your solar system, conditions supportive of life on Earth would have been destroyed. Because you were so close to the coming 2017 AD morphogenetic wave, and the potentials of ascension it holds, numerous Guardian races petitioned the Azurite Council, Elohim and Ra Confederacy on your behalf, to allow non-direct intervention in Earth\u2019s affairs. Permission was granted. On the first occasion in 1906, the asteroid was destroyed, and only portions of its debris bombarded Earth\u2019s sur- face. On the second occasion, in 1982, the asteroid was broken into two pieces and its path was diverted using electromagnetic, Keylontic technolo- gies. The asteroids are the least of the problems you have encountered within your current century.
