Before exploring the Zetas\u2019 manipulation of the Sun, let us review a brief lesson in the mechanics of multidimensional, electromagnetic fields. MERKABA FIELDS Merkaba Field Mechanics All planetary spheres possess sets of counter-rotating electromagnetic fields, within and surrounding the planetary body. In the first-dimensional frequency bands, Earth has a magnetic spiral of energy composed of the 12 base tone frequency patterns of D-1. This counter-clockwise rotating mag- netic spiral pulls energy transmitted by the Sun into the D-1 portion of Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field, Earth\u2019s D-1 Iron Core Crystal. Earth also has a clockwise-rotating, electrical, D-l energy spiral composed of the 12 overtone frequency patterns of D-1. The electrical spiral transmits energy from the D-1 portion of Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field downward, where the energy is then picked up by the D-1 magnetic spiral of the Sun. A planetary sphere has such a set of counter-rotating electromagnetic spirals within each dimensional fre- quency band. The two spirals form two pyramidal shaped energy constructs, and the magnetic spiral is inverted within the upright electrical spiral. The collective construction of the two energy fields is that of a Star tetrahedron, and this structure is referred to as a Merkaba Field. Every planet, object and person h",
