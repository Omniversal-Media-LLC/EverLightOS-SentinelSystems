Guardians from the Andromeda galaxy presently have Earth\u2019s vortices sealed under a protective D-4 frequency seal, but in the event that the Anunnaki Resistance manage to decode the fre- quency seal co-ordinates (which they occasionally do, requiring repeated guardian resealing of the vortices), the Andromies will need human help to ground a more sophisticated vortex frequency seal. Human Light-workers involved with the \u201cPortal Project\u201d are presently on stand-by, waiting for the time when they will be called into service. Human Light-workers will also assist in keeping the portal regions balanced on Earth between 2012\u20142022. ET In\ufb02uences Presently the human collective moves together toward the three diver- gent tracks of time. By 2012 the divisions within the populations will be set, as the three groups, with three different accretion levels, begin to move into their appropriate track of time. Those on the ascension track will have already made preparations in their DNA and have a more conscious under- standing of the process with which they are involved. Those on the Descending Planet time track will proceed with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, unaware of the changes taking place around them.
