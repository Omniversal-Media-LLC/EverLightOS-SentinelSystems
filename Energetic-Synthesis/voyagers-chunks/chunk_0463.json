First we would like to point out that some of those subjects did indeed experience actual abductions, but had no conscious memory of the encounter. You have not properly screened your test subjects prior to your experiments (using the hypnotic regression techniques mentioned previously), therefore subjects who did indeed have repressed abduction memories participated in the experiments, thus contaminating the apparent results of those experiments. Secondly, yes, you can create abduction-like experiences (or any other perceptual target) by electrically or chemically stimulating certain areas of the brain, or other areas of the body's neurological or cellular structure. You are interpreting the results of your present contaminated experiments so as to indicate that all abductions are false events, representing either \u201ccover memories,\u201d hallucination-like mental events or outright hoaxes. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let us say this to you\u2014just because you are able to simulate an actual event does not mean that the event cannot exist in organic form.
