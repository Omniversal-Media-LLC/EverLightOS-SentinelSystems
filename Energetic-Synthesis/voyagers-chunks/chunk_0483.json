The form construction of the mind is created through organized groupings of Partiki units or \u201celectrotonal units of consciousness.\u201d The form construction of the mind has multiple levels that correspond directly to the form construction of the 15-dimensional universe. Dimensions exist as smaller Unified Fields of energy within the larger structures of the Universal and Cosmic Unified Fields. Like the structure of the mind, the cosmos is also composed of organizations of Partiki units that form a crystalline matrix upon and within which all differentiated forms and identities are created. Dimensions are smaller organizations of crystalline Partiki structure that form distinct bands of frequency\u2014patterns of electromagnetic, light, sound and scalar waves \u2014that serve to arrange consciousness in ways through which perception and dimensionalized creation can take place. The structure of the mind is interwoven with the greater structures of the Cosmic Unified Field. Both the structures of the cosmos and the structures of the individual mind are composed of the electrotonal energy substance of Partiki units \u2014units of electrotonal consciousness\u2014and thus the structures of the cosmos and its inherent universes can be viewed in terms of the Universal and Cosmic Mind. The individual mind exists and takes place within the dimensionalized con",
