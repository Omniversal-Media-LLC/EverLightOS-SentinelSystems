Prior to the Frequency Fence, memory of other dimensional experience during the dream state was far more lucid, as experiences the consciousness had while disassociated from its focus in the body during sleep would be stored in the form of electrical impulse within the consciousness, and when the consciousness returned to the body these elec- trical impulses would be translated through the body into coherent, sequen- tial memory patterns. (Note: conscious recall of higher dimensional experience requires the fourth DNA strand, as this strand allows the higher-dimensional experience to be transferred into the lower DNA strands and then into cellular memory and conscious recognition. The Third Lamanian/Lemurian Root Race and their Ur-Antrian Cloister, and the fourth Atlanian/Atlantean Root Race and their Breanoua Cloister did not dream multidimensionally as the later races would, because they did not have the fourth DNA strand manifest within their genetic code.
