These were not the original teachings! The manipulators utilized portions of the original teachings, distorting them, steering you away from the secrets held within your bodies, feeding you the erroneous idea that you could connect with your soul by disowning the body, when in truth you must connect with the Soul Matrix through the biological form. The teachings were twisted to make you believe that you could \u201cfind God\u201d by searching outside of yourselves, or by appeasing some self-appointed authority figure who had the power to hold your divinity for you. You were led to follow the \u201cletter\u201d rather than the \u201cspirit\u201d of the \u201claw\u201d and the \u201claws\u201d you were taught to follow had been purposely misinterpreted so the individual could not make a personal connection to Source. At one time, during the early development of the species, when the adepts were working to nurture the intellectual facilities and repress the \u201cghost \u201cmemories, many of these teachings were pertinent.
