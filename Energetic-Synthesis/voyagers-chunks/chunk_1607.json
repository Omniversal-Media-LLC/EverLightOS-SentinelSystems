Information of this discovery was released to the public this year, with expedition photographs showing breath-taking, massive Selenite Crystal rods. These Selenite rods are small by comparison to those of the many main network installations. Photos and information concerning the \u201cOf\ufb01cial Science\u201d aspects of this discovery can be found on various Internet sites. Since childhood, I knew that this ancient Inter-stellar Crystalline Photo-sonic communications and transmitting network existed. On several occasions, GA Priests of UR escorted me through the Cloaking Shield (Photo-sonic security force \ufb01eld) of the subterranean Crystal Caverns system that links Earth to the portals of the Inner Earth Time Cycle. The Nibiruian Crystal Temple Network communications and transmission network is connected to and run through the Crystal Caverns system.
