We need a critical mass of people to reach 4.5 accretion before 2012 in order for the Earth\u2019s grid to raise high enough in speed to enter the Bridge Zone in 2012. The accretion level of Earth is being continually measured and moni- tored, and as of this writing (August 1998) things look quite promising. Recent events involving the Sphere of Amenti have given us much encouragement for the success of the Bridge Zone Project, and we are still on schedule for the opening of the Halls of Amenti in 20I2. The transition of Earth moving into the Bridge Zone began in 1997 as we infused Earth\u2019s grid with UHF energy to assist in raising the particle pulsation rate of Earth\u2019s core. The speed of Earth\u2019s core particles will be progressively raised between now and 2012. As Earth progressively moves closer to 2012, a subtle division will begin to appear within the populations of Earth. Those with higher accretion rates will progressively find themselves surrounded by others of similar accretion levels, and those with low accretion rates will likewise group. You will see a more apparent division between what you consider the \u201clight and dark forces\u201d moving within your populations. You may see extremes of this condi- tion, especi",
