  "text": "Stellar Activations Through these dimensional energetic capsule structures, the chakra system, or dimensional energy supply system, is formed. Through the chakra system a form\u2019s particle base builds up into structures of multidimensional matter. The 15 energetic capsules exist within the same space, separated by variance in dimensional particle pulsation rhythms. The energetic form of the capsules gives the auric field the appearance of capsules within capsules, or 15 distinct, interpenetrating, capsule-shaped layers. The process of dimensional ascension and biological and planetary evo- lution is the process of accretion or the drawing of successive multidimen- sional frequency bands into the morphogenetic field. As a planetary body or human body evolves through frequency accretion, the energetic capsules within the auric field progressively undergo transmutation of form. Once a morphogenetic field has accreted most of the frequency bands from the three dimensions that compose one Harmonic Universe, the energy capsules that correspond to these three lower dimensions begin to dissolve. The particles contained within the dissolving auric capsules open into the auric capsules of the next three highest dimensions, in the next Harmonic universe up. This is the energetic dynamic by which forms and consciousness progressively evolve from one Harmonic Universe to the next. The process",
