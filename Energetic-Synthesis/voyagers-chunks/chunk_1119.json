  "text": "Ascending and Descending Planets els of the planet\u2019s body, is being increased and the angular rotation of particle spin is being shifted. These adjustments constitute a shift of the planetary bodies into faster moving time cycles. The consciousness of those upon the planet must also make such a shift, and the particles of which the body and consciousness are composed will undergo the same acceleration of pulsation speed and change in angular rotation of particle spin. Normally, when a planet reached its half-point in its second ascension cycle, which constitutes the 2.5-accretion level, the electrical overtone parti- cles of its D-3 Merkaba Fields would merge with their anti-particles, form a morphogenetic wave and transfer into the next Harmonic Universe into the sixth-dimensional frequency bands. Also included in this morphogenetic wave are the electrical overtone particles of the D-1 and D-2 Merkaba Fields. The D-2 overtone electrical particles transfer to D-5 and the D-1 electrical overtone particles transfer into D-4. So normally, during the half-point mor- phogenetic wave the clockwise rotating electrical Merkaba Fields of D-1, D-2 and D-3 open up and merge with the counterclockwise rotating magnetic Merkaba Fields of D-4, D-5 and D-6. During the 10-year period surrounding the half-point, all of the electrical overtone particles that Earth had pulled in from dimensions 1,",
