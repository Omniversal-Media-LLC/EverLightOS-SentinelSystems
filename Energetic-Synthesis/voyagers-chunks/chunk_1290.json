  "text": "The Amenti Ascension Program Schedule base tone particles of Earth progressively merge with the D-4 overtone anti-particles of Tara, within the pulsation rhythm of the D-4 time cycle. Earth\u2019s particle base temporarily raises to an accretion level of 4, its ele- mental particle base raises to 5-accretion and its atmospheric particle base raises to a 6-accretion level. Earth will remain in the D-4 time cycle until the morphogenetic wave crest ends at the half cycle point in 2017 and the particle fields make their final transition into their respective time cycles. The reversal and shifting of the magnetic and electrical poles of Earth and Tara does not create a physical pole reversal or shift, because the action of reversal and shift of Earth and Tara are simultaneous and counter-balance each other, as long as both grids are properly aligned. In areas where the grids are not bal- anced and aligned, tectonic cracking and shifting, and volcanic activity of varying degrees may result. The reversal of particle activity will be prima- rily undetectable to earthly equipment and human perception, as such devices are also composed of particles, which will shift along with Earth\u2019s dimensional perception. There will be some subtle observable variance in Earth\u2019s magnetic fields, and an increase in gamma wave activity. The Hall of Records will begin transmitting data through the Sphere of Am",
