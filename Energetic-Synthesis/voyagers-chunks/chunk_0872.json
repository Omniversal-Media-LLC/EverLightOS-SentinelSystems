Without these frequencies, the fourth-dimensional frequency bands could not connect to the Earth's 3- dimensional body, so the Sphere of Amenti would be halted within the low- est frequency bands of the fourth dimension, as the path of frequency through which it would descend into the third dimension was severed. It would remain in the astral plane until the 3-dimensional frequencies were re- entered into the Earth's morphogenetic field. Without those frequencies the Earth would not be able to pull those specific tones into its planetary grid, so Earth would be halted in its tracks of time within the middle frequency bands of the third dimension. Though this protective measure was necessary at the time, it also stunted the planet's ability to evolve naturally out of HU-1. The guardians intended to release the Frequency Fence during an appropriate time cycle period, once the Earth grid had rebalanced and its vibrational rate had increased enough to accept a rapid return of the Sphere of Amenti. There were certain advantages and several drawbacks to this Frequency Fence plan. The 10th-12th overtones of the third dimension were left within the Earth's morphogenetic field, which meant that a portion of Earth's parti- cles would manifest within the 10th-12th frequency bands of the third dimension. A higher-vibrational \u201cEarth phantom\u201d was created",
