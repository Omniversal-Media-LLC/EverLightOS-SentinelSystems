However, once Earth was above the frequency fence, it could not be re-entered into the dimensional bands below the fence. The Merkaba Fields of Earth would re-seal in 2017, locking Earth into the Bridge Zone time continuum. If the Guardians were going to force an early Doreadeshi, by moving both the overtone/electrical fields and the base tone/magnetic fields of Earth into the Bridge Zone time continuum cycle during the 2017 half- cycle point, the move would have to be permanent. BRIDGE ZONE MECHANICS The idea of shifting a planetary body from one time continuum to another may seem quite outrageous to a civilization that does not yet have a working comprehension of multidimensional physics. We assure you that such a procedure is most definitely real and valid in terms of the structural energetic dynamics of the Time Matrix. This procedure is not used fre- quently, for it is a complex and delicate process requiring direct intervention from the higher Harmonic Universes of HU-3 -HU-5. For the most part, planets and civilizations are allowed to evolve along the course of their own development, following their own choices and meeting with the conse- quences of those choices. But occasionally a planet and its peoples get into trouble that has far-reaching consequences for nu",
