We refer to the individuals who will complete bodily ascension as the V oyagers. To become a V oyager one must fully assemble the fifth DNA strand no later than 2022. After 2022, this first time track is no longer an option. In this future one would expect to experience subtle com- munications with a guardian group of either ET or metaterrestrial nature, prior to the ascension period. Through this communication one will be taught how to prepare for their personal ascension, and will be given times and locations as to when and where the physical event will take place.
