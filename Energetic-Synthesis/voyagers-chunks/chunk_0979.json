  "text": "f the process occurs when the grids of Earth and Tara come into full alignment at the half-point in the cycle, at which time the morpho- genetic wave fully crests, and the grids of Earth and Tara begin pulling away from each other. The crest of the morphogenetic wave begins about five years before, and extends up to the half-cycle point. During the five-year crest of the morphogenetic wave, all of Earth\u2019s overtone particles, and Tara\u2019s base- tone anti-particles, fully transmute into the morphogenetic fields. As Earth\u2019s overtone particles become progressively suspended in hyper-space and the dimensional base-tone frequencies left within the Earth\u2019s grid begin to blend with the overtone anti-particles in Tara's grid, an Harmonic Resonant Tone is formed. Through the Harmonic Resonant Tone the spin and polarity of 112",
