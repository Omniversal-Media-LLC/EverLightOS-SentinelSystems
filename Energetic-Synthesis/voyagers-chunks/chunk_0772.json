There are natural energy dynamics that govern the merger of multidimensional frequency bands, part of which involves particles and anti-particles merging. Particles and anti-particles are composed of units of multidimensional sound, or tones, and within each frequency band there are base tones and overtones. The process of merging particles and anti-particles in order to cre- ate the merging of frequency patterns is the process of bringing together base tones and overtones that emerged out of the same morphogenetic field. When base tone and overtone merge, a resonant tone is created, through which particle and antiparticle merge, and transmute into pure energy. They return to the morphogenetic field carrying with them the new frequency pat- terns they picked up from the Unified Field of the dimension in which they appeared, which in turn expands and adds energy to the original morphoge- netic field. When the particles and anti-particles are next expressed into manifestation, they will appear within the next frequency band up, as their rate of vibration was increased by adding the frequency patterns from the dimension they just left. It is through this process of building dimensional",
