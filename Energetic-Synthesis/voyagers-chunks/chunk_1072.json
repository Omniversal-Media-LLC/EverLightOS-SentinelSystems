Along with this, 144,000 individuals would need to fully assemble the sixth strand, embody their entire soul matrix and begin to assemble the seventh-twelfth strands. This acceleration of the human genetic imprint would release the D-4 Zeta Seal from all of the human races, present and future, and would allow Earth\u2019s grid speed to raise high enough to remain in the Bridge Zone. Following the shift to the Bridge Zone, Earth would leap ahead 2213 years by skipping the second half of its D-3 cycle, then move backward in time 1106.5 years within the Bridge Zone cycle. After completing 1106.5 years in the Bridge Zone, Earth would leap ahead another 1106.5 years by skipping the first half of its first D-4 cycle. Earth would then pass into the first D-4 cycle at the half-cycle point and continue its path of natural evolution through the D-4 time cycles. This movement of 2213 years ahead, 1106.5 back, and 1106.5 ahead in time represents a cumulative leap of 2213 years in evolutionary space-time progression. The Dracos-Zeta Frequency Fence would end up in the dimensional frequency bands below the Bridge Zone fre- quency bands in which the Earth was positioned, and thus Earth\u2019s grid would be unaffected. However, once Earth was above the frequency fence, it could not be re-entered into the dimensional bands below the fence. The Merkaba Fields",
