  "text": "Others call them the \u201clizzies,\u201d referring specifically to the Rutilia sub-species of Zeta that have a more reptilian-like appearance when manifesting within your system. Though technologically and intellectually astute the Zeta generally do not possess the spiritual development necessary to forge strong bonds of brotherhood with other life forms. Like humans, the Zeta also are evolving. The Zeta are indeed real, and physical in terms of biological form. They are not from your planetary system, but they have a working knowledge of the Time Portal System in your dimension. It is the Zeta and affiliated groups, such as the reptilian Dracos, that have been in contact with your government and are responsible for much of what you have come to call the \u201cUFO/alien abduction\u201d phenomena. Little Greys The Zeta represent more than just the Little Greys (those small greyish beings with large black eyes).",
