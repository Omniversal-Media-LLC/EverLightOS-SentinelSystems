Most of the human races retreated underground, cre- ating sophisticated cultures beneath the Earth's crust, some races being per- mitted to enter the portals of the Inner Earth. Once environmental conditions stabilized, many races returned to surface life, rebuilding their civ- ilizations. Though most of the Drakon had vacated or perished, they left a legacy of genetic distortion behind them, that threatened the continuation of the human lineage. Earth-animal interbreeding became a problem in the races of the Second Seeding and Host Matrix Transplants ( see V oyagers I, 2e, p. 76.) were being used to realign the human genetic codes. The races of Amenti began to digress further due to Drakon contamination of the genetic lines, and several other ET races used this opportunity to experiment with the human evolutionary imprint. Some of the more primitive human-like forms of \u201cearly man\u201d arose from such experiments, as did some of the apelike human varieties. But the human lineage did not originate from these primitive forms. These forms emerged from the distorted human imprint. Many such mutations were also created prior to the Electric Wars.
