The morphogenetic field of a person exists as part of the larger morpho- genetic field of the planet, and so when a planet approaches the dimensional blending point in its time cycle, the people on the planet also reach that point. People's bodies and consciousness are composed of energy particles, and when the planet approaches transition and transmutation of some of its particles, people on the planet will also undergo this particle transmutation. Just as only por- tions of the planet's particles will be able to transmute and ascend into the next dimension through the morphogenetic wave, only portions of the human population will be able to transmute and ride with the planet on that wave of ascension. People who have fully assembled the third- and fourth- dimensional frequencies into their DNA (fully assembled the dimensional frequencies into their third and fourth DNA strand) will be able to ride that wave of ascension back into Tara's energetic tapestry, which perceptually constitutes a leap in time. The personal morphogenetic field and conscious- ness will be carried within the planet's morphogenetic wave, which will merge with Tara's fourth, fifth and sixth-dimensiona",
