  "text": "actual craft belonging to human or extra-terrestrial cultures that emerge through the Time Portal System from locations within the third- dimensional universe. In all of these cases the craft appear physically solid, some having material wreckage left behind as validation of their existence. There have been photographs, film, radar and eye-witness accounts of all such phenomena, though rarely are your sightings researchers able to make distinctions between these categories unless obvious visitor presence is indicated. There are other categories of UFOs related to these which need to be addressed. Quite often there are reports of encounters with UFOs that do not have the characteristic physical vessel structures as mentioned above. Often reports of \u201cparanormal\u201d activity also fall into this category. Frequently sightings of this sort are dismissed as naturally occurring atmospheric anomalies or mental aberrations. We are referring here to the sightings and encounters of phenomena that appear as light-form manifestations. There is a wide variety of such displays ranging from simple \u201cflashes\u201d or \u201csheets\u201d of light (witnessed both indoors and outdoors) to large appearances of spherical light forms, singularly or in group formation, that appear as three-dimensional energy forms. Often when these are photographed they appear as UFOs though usually a vessel or solid-mass source of light",
