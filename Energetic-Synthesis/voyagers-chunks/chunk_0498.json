The Superconscious Mind represents the creative and organizational component of mind through which the individuated identity is imbued with purpose, intention, motivation and the literal life-force energy through which the HU-1 body is sustained. Embodiment of the Soul Matrix through the evolutionary process of Soul Integration allows the lower dimensional components of mind to fully assimilate into an advanced state of consciousness through which the identity recognizes the plural nature of its simultaneous existence in various dimensions and space-time locations. The Soul Matrix identity manifests as a singular, less-dense matter body within the frequency fields of HU-2 and experiences its HU-1 incarnates as Cellular Memory of its smaller, simultaneous manifestations that exist in HU-1. The incarnate identity was designed to expand back into the Soul Matrix identity following death or transmutation of the HU-1 physical body. The Soul Matrix and Superconscious Mind connect the HU-1 incarnates and the HU-2 Soul Body to the higher dimensional levels of identity and to the original Geomantic Entity Gestalt that exists eternally beyond dimensionalization.
