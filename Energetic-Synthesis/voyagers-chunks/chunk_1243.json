  "text": "D-4 Seal of Palaidor is a genetic mutation from 5,500,000 years ago, which caused a blockage between the second and third chakras, a division between the second, third and fourth levels of the auric field and separation between emotional, mental and astral identity levels. This seal is released by fully assembling the fourth DNA strand. Release of this seal allows polarization in the fourth/heart chakra to reverse, and the D-2 emotional, D-3 mental and D-4 astral levels of awareness to merge. The nadial cap- sule (barrier between D-3 and D-4 frequency levels in the auric field) dis- solves and the blockage between the D-3 conscious perceptions and D-2 sub-conscious mind releases. Release of the Seal of Palaidor represents the \ufb01rst stage of soul integration, as the conscious D-3 identity begins to access the D-4 astral planes and skills of D-4 projection of consciousness and multidimensional communication develop. The Seal of Amenti, the Death Seal, is a genetic mutation from 5,508,100 years ago, a mutation in DNA strand 1, which caused a block- age between the physical and etheric body. The sixth activation code (overtone) of the first DNA strand was removed, which caused mutation in the first, second and third DNA strands, that manifested as a block between the body\u2019s particles and the anti-particles of the body-double in the parallel universe. This seal ended humanity\u2019 s abi",
