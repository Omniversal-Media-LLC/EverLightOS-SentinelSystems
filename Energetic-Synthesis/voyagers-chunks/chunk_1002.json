In this case Earth and the races would be trapped for another 26,556 years within HU-1, the mass assembly of the fifth DNA strand would not occur, and the majority of Earth\u2019s people would have to reincarnate into HU-1 until the next morphogenetic wave. This is only the beginning of the problems that would occur if the Blue Flame were not embodied on Earth during the time of grid intersection. If the Earth grid could not link with Tara\u2019s, the Earth grid speed would slow in vibration due to the excessive particle content that it could not release through the first morphogenetic wave. After 2,213 years had passed and the final morphogenetic wave of the cycle was due, the Earth grid vibra- tion would be too low to hold the Sphere of Amenti and the Blue Flame, so the grids of Earth and Tara again would be unable to merge. At the close of the ascension cycle Earth\u2019s excessive particle content and density would make its grid speed and particle pulsation rate slow to the speed of the D-l frequency bands. Earth would plunge from the sixth, and final, D-3 time con- tinuum cycle in HU-1, back into the First D-1 time continuum cycle, of HU- 1. From this D-1 position, Earth would have to evolve through another 26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle in HU-1, before having another opportu- nity to ascend to HU-2. As you can perhaps now",
