The only members of the human population on Earth that organically possessed the sixth DNA strand imprint are the groups who have undergone genetic acceleration through earlier Zionite intervention\u2014those who carry the Celestial 12-strand Silicate Matrix gene code. The Keepers of the Blue, Violet and Orange-Gold Flames also possess this genetic configura- tion. The Sixth Root Race Muvarians and their Melchizedek Cloister race are born with the fourth DNA strand assembled and the imprint for the fifth strand dormant. The Muvarians have not yet begun their birthing cycle on Earth. The Melchizedek Cloister race must fully assemble the fifth DNA strand before it can activate the imprints for strands 6 and above. Members of all of these races must fully assemble and activate the lower strands, then assemble and activate the sixth strand by completing at least three Stellar-Star Crystal Activations, before Earth can receive the needed concentration of D-6 frequency these acti- vated sixth strand individuals would provide. There is little time left before the 2012\u20142017 ascension period begins for a minimum of 144,000 individuals to awaken to their soul purposes and consciously complete these Stellar activa- tions to activate their sixth DNA strand.
