Our Earth\u2019s remains from that period would not be found here, they would exist within the particle base of parallel Earth in the anti-particle universe. Otherworld races visiting Earth while the planet was in the anti-particle universe would leave evidence of their activities within the grounds of parallel-Earth. We would not be able to unearth these remains until our particle Earth passed back into the anti- particle universe, following the successful completion of its 26,556-year evolutionary cycle. In the present 26,556-year time cycle, Earth passed into the parallel anti-particle universe in 13,474 BC, remained there for two time continua cycles (8852 years), then returned to the particle universe in 4622 BC. Our Earth\u2019s archeological remains from the time period of 13,474 BC through 4622 BC, would not be found on our Earth; they would exist on parallel Earth. Archeological remains found on our Earth, that can be dated to the period of 13,474 BC to 4622 BC, would actually represent the remains of civilizations and life forms that existed on parallel Earth during this period of time. The Particle Transition process of multi-dimensional planetary evolution is very complex and utterly alien to our scientific communities, yet it is a cohesive model, consistent with the str",
