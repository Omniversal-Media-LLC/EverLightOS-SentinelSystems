(This energy current exists, it can be viewed with higher sensory perception and is frequently called the \u201cMain Vertical Current.\u201d) Move the spinning Symbol Code into this center-line of energy in synchronization with your breathing rhythm. Move the Symbol Code inward as you inhale, then as you exhale, stop the Symbol Code movement at whatever level you sense it to be, and resume moving the Symbol Code with the next inhale. Repeat the inhale-movement/exhale- stop sequence until you sense that the Symbol Code is positioned within your body directly in the middle of the internal center line, beneath the Chakra on which you traced the Symbol Code. Once the Symbol Code is positioned within the internal center- line, breathe 4-6 breaths, feeling the energy of the Symbol Code expand until it feels about the size of a grapefruit, still within the same area of the body/Chakra center upon which the Symbol Code was traced. If you are sensitive to subtle energies you will feel a \u201cstopping sensation\u201d as the Symbol Code has reached full expansion within the Chakra. Continue to pay attention to your breathing and as you inhale imagine",
