These conditions keep the human locked within the space-time coor- dinates of Earth's present time cycle. For humans to shift out of the D-3 time cycle and into the Bridge Zone with the majority of Earth\u2019s particle base, the human body must complete a minimum of 1.5 Stellar Activations. Through the process of the first two Stellar Activations, two Star Crystal Seals will activate and two Star Crystal Seals will release, allowing the particle pulsa- tion rhythm of the three-dimensional human body to increase and the angu- lar rotation of particle spin to shift into that of the HU-2 time cycles. Each of the six Stellar Activations the Earth will encounter between 2000 and 2017 can also be achieved by humans upon the planet, because the interdimensional Stellar Spirals come into alignment during this time period. Each of the six Activations will activate various Star Crystals Seals within the human body, if the human chakra system is used appropriately to draw in frequency patterns and light spectra from the Stellar Spirals. When the Star Crystal Seals activate, as a result of this infusion of fre- quency, each progressively opens vario",
