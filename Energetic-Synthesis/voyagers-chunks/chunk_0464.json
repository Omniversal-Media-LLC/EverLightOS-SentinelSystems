The fact that you can recreate or duplicate an effect does not prove nor imply that the original affect does not occur organically. In regard to brain manipulation, through electrical or chemical means, you can indeed create many \u201cfalse memory\u201d or \u201cvirtual reality- like\u201d experiences. At the present time you are not fully aware of the mechanics of cellular memory storage and retrieval. Your scientists have failed to realize that every cell stores not only memory, in the form of coded electrical impulse, but also stores the very codes of translation, the Keylonta light-symbol codes. They are the means by which memory is translated into sensual data and the means by which the illusion of three-dimensional reality is manufactured. Let us compare these Keylonta light-symbol codes (or \u201cFire Letters\u201d) to an alphabet, an alphabet that is multi-dimensional, and whose characters change placement, meaning and sound depending upon the dimensional frequency with which they interface. The Fire Letters of this \u201calphabet\u201d are stored within every cell of every human; it is the basis for the human genetic code. Through this \u201ccellular alphabet\u201d impulses of electromagnetic energy are aligned and ordered, much as words are formed out of the different",
