As long as the electromagnetic fields of both planets are in balance, this simultaneous 45\u00b0 shift in angular rotation and reversal of polarity in particles and anti-particles will not cause a shift of the physical Earth on its axis. The electromagnetic fields of each planet keep the fields of the other in balance. Some \ufb02uctuation in Earth\u2019s magnetism may be detected, and some tectonic movement may occur in areas that are not fully energetic- cally balanced, but the basic structure of the Earth\u2019s body will remain intact. If the grids are not balanced, however, a full 45\u00b0 tilt of Earth\u2019s rotation upon its axis could result, which would create massive Earth changes. It is very important that the Earth\u2019 s bio-energetic structure and electromagnetic grid are bal- anced during this \ufb01ve-year period. In this five-year transition during the crest of the morphogenetic wave, the magnetic grid of particle Earth becomes electrical, and the electrical grid of anti-particle Tara becomes magnetic. The two planetary grids merge and some of the land mass contours of Tara emerge on Earth as etheric overtone structures. When particle Earth returns to its particle time cycle in HU-1, these land masses will manifest first on the a",
