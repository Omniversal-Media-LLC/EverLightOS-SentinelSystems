You are taught, just as your parents had been, to believe that you are only what exists between the top of your head and the tip of your toes. You are trained to doubt the self, fear the self, punish the self and to place your trust in authorities or \u201cexperts\u201d that exist outside of you. You are taught to long for but be afraid of power, and to fear your ability to handle it wisely. Emotion is power, and so it is expected that within this program you are taught to invalidate and repress emotional cognition. The intuitions and higher senses give you direct access to greater power and knowledge. And you are taught to negate, fear, devalue, disown and discredit intuitive perception and knowledge. Does it sound like this \u201cofficial\u201d mainstream program is designed to help you to become empowered or free? You are programmed to believe that what is on the outside is more important than what is on the inside and to continually distract yourselves with the more important external aspects of reality. Does your mainstream program encourage you to look within for answers, to discover your own innate power to create change or to spend time exploring the vast uncharted frontier that exists \u201cbetween your ears\u201d? The \u201caverage American\u201d is far",
