  "text": "ted fission and fusion, Partiki manufacture two intrinsic sub-units of crystalline morphoge- netic substance that serve as blueprints for rhythms of pulsation through which particles and anti-particles manifest. The Partiki sub-units that pulsate the fastest are called Partika and they set the pulsation rhythm through which Partiki units will group to form anti-particles. Partiki sub-units that pulsate more slowly and appear in conjunction with the Partika are called Particum. The Particum set the pulsation rhythm through which Partiki units will group to form particles that are a slower pul- sating reflection of the Partika anti-particles. Together the Partiki, Partika and Particum set the foundations for particle and anti-particle manifestation 453",
