Zeta are the least skilled in this area as they lack certain bioenergetic characteristics (the \u201cemotional body\u201d energies) that are required to fully master the art of transmutation. They can link forms and partially transmute, but to do so causes excessive drain upon their own biological systems. Most often the Zeta will remain physical and use simple frequency modulation tactics to \u201cscramble\u201d the brain wave patterns of those viewing them3. They are there, but they can interfere with the human\u2019s bioelectrical system sufficiently enough to make themselves appear invisible, \u201cghost-like\u201d or disguised in other forms.

The Old Zeta Agenda There are a large number of Zeta involved with research upon your planet, and some of them possess agendas you need to become aware of so you do not fall into their plans as they desire. Your Interior Government has been working with the Zeta on some of these agendas but even they do not realize what is being orchestrated.
