The design for the Sphinx was chosen, by the Indigo Child Maji, Angelic Human and Emerald Covenant-loyal Annunaki races of Earth, as a tribute to the Elohei- Elohim Leonine Christos Founders race. The structure broadcast a statement to the Fallen Annu-Elohim and Annunaki Fallen Angelic collectives that the Earth races were united under the common banner of the Founders\u2019 Emerald Covenant Co-Evolution Peace Treaty . The design of the original Sphinx was a three-dimensional representation of the Great White Lion APIN system, created from translating the Founders\u2019 APIN maps, as held in the Emerald Covenant CDT-Plate records. The primary purpose of the Great White Lion APIN was to assist Earth through natural Stellar Activation Cycles until Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields could be repaired from the damage incurred during the Electric Wars cataclysm. If the Great Lion, and its companion \u201cGolden Eagle\u201d APIN systems had not been installed following the Electric Wars, Earth would suffer cataclysmic pole shift during every SAC, and eventually the planet would implode due to the severity of its Scalar Template distortions. The Great White Lion APIN was modeled in the image of the feline- hominid Elohei-Elohim Leonine Christos Founders of D-12 Lyra, Aramatena. It represented the D-12 (silver-white) Lyran-Sirian APIN system of Earth, the \u201canchoring rod\u201d and stabilization grid for 12 Primary Ax",
