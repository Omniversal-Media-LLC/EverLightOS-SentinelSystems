Once the Sphere of Amenti was opened, if the D-4 frequencies could not enter Earth\u2019s core in 1/2000, the D-4 Merkaba Field of Tara, the gold core crystal stored at the center of the Sun, would explode. In this event, not only would Earth explode, but so would the other 10 planets of the local solar sys- tem and the Sun, all of which are energetically attached to the D-4 Merkaba Field gold core crystal. This would begin a similar chain reaction within the Pleiadian star system, to which Earth\u2019s Sun belongs. As you may now under- stand, balance and timing are extremely important factors when the Halls of Amenti open. In order to remove the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence, the Merkaba Fields of the Sun would have to be carefully realigned no later than 6/1994, which would allow one and one-half years for the Earth\u2019s grids to rebalance before the Frequency Fence was lifted. Realigning the solar fields is a delicate process in and of itself, but this process combined with the general preparations of opening the Halls of Amenti within the scheduled deadlines served to make the Guardians\u2019 task even more complex.
