If the Earth\u2019s grid is balanced in 2012, the Dracos-Zeta Resistance and the Anunnaki Resistance will leave. Earth\u2019s populations can then focus upon the primary issues at hand, assisting the Guardians to keep Earth\u2019s grid balanced and accelerating personal evolution in preparation for the opening of the Halls of Amenti between 2012\u20142022. If 92% of Earth\u2019s populations could reach a 4.5-accretion level by 2012, no one would take the second track of time back into the D-3 time cycle of the Descending Earth. This is not likely, however, so as it stands some of the Earth\u2019s populations will indeed return to the D-3 continuum. These are the only individuals susceptible to the Dracos-Zeta Frequency Fence, and we hope that the Interior Government will stop the 2003 experiment so these individuals do not have to contend with the Frequency Fence and resulting changes of the D-3 Earth. If humans begin working now to consciously assemble DNA and increase accretion level, there is still time to become immune to that intended Frequency Fence and prepare to leave the D-3 con- tinuum. If you can achieve a 4.5-accretion level by 2012 you will automati- cally end up in the Bridge Zone continuum in 2017. As long as 8% of Earth\u2019s populations reach a 5-accretion level, 144,00",
