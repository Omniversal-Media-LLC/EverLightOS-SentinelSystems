Begin to form a Pale Silver ball of Maharic frequency. On each exhale send your energy down to the Earth\u2019s Core to bring up another load of Maharic frequency, up from the Planetary Shields, expand it into the Heart center and repeat several times. Notice that the Cord grows larger as you do this, expanding from approximately 4\" to 6 to 8\" diameter, until finally it feels like a skin around (as well as within) your body. . .as you load your Astral field with Maharic Frequency. 502",
