Without this interdimensional Reso- nant Tone, created through the merger of Earth\u2019s D-2 core frequencies with the D-4 Solar Spiral frequencies, Earth would not be able to achieve its temporary shift into the HU-2 time cycle. If Earth is unable to make this shift, the grids of Earth and Tara will not fully merge and the Bridge Zone project will fail. The Halls of Amenti will not open, the planetary ascension process will halt and Earth and its populations will remain trapped within the HU-1 time cycle to fall under Dracos-Zeta Resistance control. The striking of this lnterdimensional Resonant Tone is a natural part of Earth\u2019s ascension cycle, and will take place on 1/1/2000, as Earth\u2019s grid has reached the necessary particle pulsation rhythm as of 6/26/1998. The event of the interdimensional Resonant Tone Striking will occur on schedule. The alignment between Earth\u2019s D-2 core and the D-4 Solar Spiral and the resulting Interdimensional Resonant Tone created through this alignment, constitutes a Day of Transcendence, for Earth and its populations. The boundaries of Earth\u2019s 26,556-year HU-1 time cycle, and humanity\u2019s entrapment within HU-1 physical matter, will be temporarily Transcended. This Day of Transcendence marks the \ufb01rst day of E",
