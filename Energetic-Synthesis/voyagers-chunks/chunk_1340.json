I AM the Truth that Spans the Sands of Time, I AM the Rainbow of the Very First Shine, I AM Music, I AM Light. Let the Light Descend Upon Me, Guide the Way with Golden Light, No Other God will Stand Before Me... As I Embrace the One True Life I was Born to Live... By the Will of the Original ONE. I AM a Face of the Original God, I AM a V oice of the Original Sound, I AM a Wave Upon the Ocean of Eternal Light. I Reach My Arms Up Unto the Heavens, and say, I AM THIS I AM. The Presence of the Ancient One Springs Forth at My Command. I AM One With God, I AM THIS I AM... And, as I Decree It, So It Is. 239",
