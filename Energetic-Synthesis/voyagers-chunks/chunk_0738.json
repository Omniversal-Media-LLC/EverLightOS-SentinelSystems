Through the Dagos, Kantarian and HU-1 Pleiadian lineage became intertwined with the original Turaneusiam-2 imprint during the Second Seeding. The Dagos were a dark brown skinned race whose genetic imprint would be carried as a recessive gene within the human strain of the Second Seeding. The Dagos were brought to Earth to set up small colonies in various locations about 3,995,750 years ago. Reseeding of the Cloistered and Root Races of Amenti began, starting with the Ur-Antrian Cloister 3,700,000 years ago, followed by Root Race 3, three mil- lion years ago. Root Race 3, the Lumarians, became the Lamanians, denoting their passage through Sirius B. The Fourth Root Race and its Cloister entered next, the Breanoua Cloister, about three million years ago, followed by the Alanian Root Race 4 at 2,500,000 years ago. The Alanians became known as the Atlanians. The Fifth Root Race Aeirans and their Cloister Hibiru then entered, the Hibiru 1,500,000 and the Ayrians 1,275,000 years ago. The time period beginning with the Second Seeding 3,700,000 years ago and extending through the Th",
