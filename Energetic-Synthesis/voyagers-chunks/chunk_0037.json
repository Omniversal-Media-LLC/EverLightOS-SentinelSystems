In more recent analysis apparent genetic discrepancies and missing links within this hypothetical model of progression have discredited the potential accuracy of the primate-evolution theory and this model of origins is no longer viewed with the scientific enthusiasm it once inspired. Conclusion 8: The primate-evolution model simply represents a possible theory of human origin, it is by no means a paradigm carved in stone. The truth of the matter is that our scientists are still guessing, they do not yet know the facts of human origins and they can offer us only assumptions using their present body of knowledge. Through genetic analysis and archeological discovery the sciences have unearthed various pieces of evidence related to the evolution of early human culture. The facts of historical evidence of our origins are simply these: we have certain genetic similarities to various early hominid and primate species, remains of primitive man have been found during periods when Homo sapiens was not evidenced on Earth and Homo sapiens remains are evidenced after species of primitive man had apparently disappeared. These facts can be interpreted in a variety of ways, from attempting to fit them into the primate-evolutionist model, to considering the possibilities that the Homo sapiens and primitive man species were independently seeded here, at different times, by visiting",
