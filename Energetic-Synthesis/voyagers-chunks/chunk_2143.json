Following the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, por- tions of Earth and its populations co-resonant to the Inner Earth Bridge Zone Time Continuum will remain in the stable areas of the 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble Safe Zone, which is referred to as the Meajh\u00e9 Field, until 2012 . Until 2012, the Meajh\u00e9 Field will be sustained by Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-9 Quatra Phase Merkaba Vehicle, when final transition into the Bridge Zone time continuum will take place. Meajh\u00e9 Field Safe Zones, or \u201cMeajh\u00e9 Zones\u201d will provide a natural fre- quency buffer to the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period frequency infusions and will be the most environmentally and culturally stable areas of the globe during the remainder of the SAC. Meajh\u00e9 Zones will also provide environmental support to the progressive 12-Code DNA Template activation of Human and Indigo populations.
