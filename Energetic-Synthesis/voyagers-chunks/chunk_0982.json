When particle Earth returns to its particle time cycle in HU-1, these land masses will manifest first on the anti-particle Earth, and by the close of the full ascension cycle 2,213 years later, these new land configure- tions will manifest physically on the particle Earth. (This is what is meant by the New Age concept of literal \u201cAtlantis Rising\u201d. These lands of Tara will indeed rise up on Earth, but normally they will do so progressively over a period of 2,213 years, not all at once.) At the height of the morphogenetic wave crest, during the half-point in the cycle, there is an approximately three-day period when Earth\u2019s mag- netic fields temporarily collapse as the spin of particles and anti-particles slows, polarity again reverses, and the angle of particle rotation shifts back 113",
