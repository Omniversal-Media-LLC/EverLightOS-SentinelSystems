Presently there are more helpful crop formations in place than are their harmful counterparts. More will appear as you progress into the next century. It is important for you to understand that whether the formations are harmful or helpful they are directly influencing you in complex ways on subliminal levels. You must learn to use them, or they will instead serve as the vessels through which you are used. Attempting to destroy the visible evidence of such a formation will in no way \u201cdisarm\u201d its attributes. Once it is in place the frequency it harnessed has been indelibly coded into the land, air and biological forms of the region. It is for this reason that the helpful ETs, who became aware of how the formations were being used to harm you, found it necessary to counter the offending codes rather than to simply disengage them from operational focus. There is much you need to learn about such advanced technologies and those such as ourselves are quite willing to share our knowledge with you, so that you may learn the skills required to protect yourselves from those who wish to do and who are presently doing harm to large percentages of your populations. We will offer more extensive data on the mechanics of crop formations at a future time, for those of you in",
