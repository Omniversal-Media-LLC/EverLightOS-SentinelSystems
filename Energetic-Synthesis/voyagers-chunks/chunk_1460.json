The Earth-Tara-Gaia system would have been a Phantom Planet system (see page 166), if it had not been for the Founders\u2019 inplementation of the Angelic Human mission. Humanity, and other species, were seeded on Earth to form a sustaining energetic template through which progressive D-12 Christos Realignment and repair of Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields could be rendered over several cycles of the planet\u2019s evolution within the Density-1 Time Cycle. The design of the Cycle of the Rounds began with seeding of the Palaidia Urtite-Cloister Maji Races and was then to continue with progressive emergence of races that carried smaller portions of the Maji\u2019s DNA Tem- plate. Each race with less sophisticated DNA Templates served to bring in and hold in Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields, specific cycles of sub-frequency from the Shield of Aramatena, during points in the planetary Time Cycle when those specific sub-frequencies were needed to amplify and \u201cfill out the fre- quencies\u201d, in Earth\u2019s Manifestation Template. In the Cycle of the Rounds design, races with greater genetic sophistication serve to hold in Earth\u2019s Plan- etary Shields, the 12 Primary Dimensional Templates of the Shield of Ara- matena Christos Divine Blueprint.
