Partiki are the primary units of energy that form all mat- ter, anti-matter, pre-matter and non-matter substance. They are units of mul- tidimensional light-sound and consciousness that represent minute projections of energy-identity from the central creative cosmic source. Partiki are the organizational intelligence and operational \u201clife-force fuel\u201d behind and within all manifestations and consciousness. Partiki operate as minute self-regenerating \u201c fission-fusion generators.\u201d Through the dynamics of their interaction they create and maintain the electromagnetic fields of sound fre- quency and light spectra of which the cosmos is composed. Partiki are the smallest units of energy in the cosmos (one could find 800 bil- lion billion Partiki units in an average 3-dimensional photon). They exist within and beyond all particle and matter structures and represent the \u201cdivine substance\u201d out of which the cosmos is composed. Through interior polarization and replication, created through self-generated fission and fusion, Partiki manufacture two intrinsic sub-units of crystalline morphoge- netic substance that serve as blueprints for rhythms of pulsation through which particles and anti-particles manifest. The Partiki sub-units that pulsate the",
