Keepers of the Violet Flame Activate Seventh DNA Strand, D-7 Arcturian-Core Star Activation. Earth completes its D-6 Sirian Activation, that began in 6/2008 and D-6 frequencies from the Earth\u2019s core morphogenetic field begin transmitting through Earth\u2019s grid. As this occurs, D-7 frequencies from the Sphere of Amenti begin transmitting through Earth\u2019s grid and the Sphere of Amenti completes opening its D-6 frequency into Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field. Earth completes the first 3 Activations of its Transmutative Stellar Acti- vation cycle, and will not begin its fourth D-7 Arcturian Activation until the D-7 Arcturian Spiral aligns with the D-6 Sirian spiral on day one of the Three-day Particle Conversion Period between 5/5/2017 and 6/30/ 2017. By 1/2012 the sixth primary vortex in the Caucasus Mountains will be fully open and activated and the natural seal on the seventh primary vor- tex will begin to open and activate. Earth\u2019s seventh primary vortex is located in the Andes Mountains of western South America. The Blue Flame of Amenti begins its final approach to Earth through the Alcyone spiral. The Keepers of the Blue Flame complete their D-7 Arcturian - Core Star Activation, fully activating the seventh DNA strand to become seventh-level avatars, e",
