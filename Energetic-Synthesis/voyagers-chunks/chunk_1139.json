They will follow a different course of evolution on Descending Earth. It is much more difficult for individual souls to ascend from such a planet, as their personal connection to the Sphere of Amenti mor- phogenetic field, which allows them direct access to their higher-dimensional identity, also becomes severed. The Bridge Zone Project is an absolute necessity to ensure the survival of Earth, and it also allows humans the opportunity to evolve beyond the reaches of Dracos-Zeta manipulation. If events unfold perfectly, all humans will shift to the Bridge Zone in 2017, and thus no one will fall under Dracos-Zeta domin- ion, but the chances of such high success are slim. It is presently essential that a critical mass of humans reach a 4.5-accretion level before 2012. If this does not occur, no one will make it to the Bridge Zone continuum, the Halls of Amenti will not fully open and some degree of Earth changes will take place between 2012-2017. Humans who are able to assemble the fifth DNA strand can be rescued by guardian transports, but there will be little time for such an evacuation, and the majority of the population could not withstand transport travel to Agartha or Tara. If the Bridge Zone Project is not successful, most of the human populations will be",
