This Meajh\u00e9 Zone weakness will naturally occur as Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields transition from D-9 Quatra Phase Merkaba into D-12 Mahunta Phase Merkaba to make the final 2012 link with the Inner Earth Bridge Zone time continuum. As Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields are prepared to fulfill the 2012 shift in Angular Rotation of Particle Spin from the 4.25 Trion Buffer Blanket, the natural spin ratios of the planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba will temporarily slow. This temporary 3-4 month Quatra Phase Merkaba slowing will cause the Level-9 Planetary Maharic Seal to temporarily dip to a Level-7 (7-dimensional) Maharic Seal. During this period there is a remote chance that the UIR could utilize the \"Seven Trumpets\" sub-space sonic pulse technology on D-7 Phantom Arcturus to re-activate the Seven Jehovian Seal sites on Earth, to blast through the temporary Cap on the Wormholes before the Cap becomes permanent in 2012. If this endeavor were to be successful, and the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes were to be reactivated as the Meajh\u00e9 Zones of Earth were transitioning into the Bridge Zone con-",
