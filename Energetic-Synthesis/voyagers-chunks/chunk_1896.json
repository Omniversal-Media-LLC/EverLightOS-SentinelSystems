The primary 3-dimensional particle base of Earth, Earth\u2019s core mor- phogenetic field & the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field will make this transition. Some localized Earth changes may occur in regions of grid instability as Earth transitions to the Bridge Zone. Transfer to the Bridge Zone represents a planetary acceleration of time, through which Earth will shift to a space-time location 2213-years in the future, from its present space- time station. \u2022 Bridging Humans will perceive a progressively more distinct separation of those following the old paradigm & the new as 2012 approaches & popula- tions begin to group by higher & lower particle pulsation rhythms. These groups will literally \u201cfall out of each other\u2019s range of perception\u201d by 2017. Peo- ple of the new paradigm will progressively experience more rapid expansion of consciousness & multidimensional perception, as a natural part of the Stellar Activations they will encounter. \u2022 Bridging Humans will experien",
