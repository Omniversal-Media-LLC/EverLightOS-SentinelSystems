This tactic is most often used to distract the subject long enough to instigate the splitting of awareness; it is a more delicate procedure in some subjects and takes more time to achieve. The inserts create a diversion from the actual events that would, of themselves, cause panic or hysteria, two conditions that can have dire effects during the \u201csplitting\u201d process. Still other types of abductions utilize holographic inserts exclusively. They are often used to create present-moment or remembered experiences of \u201ctraveling aboard a spacecraft\u201d to distract the mental awareness of the abductee while electromagnetic alterations (using Keylonta) are performed on the body while it remains within the three-dimensional frequency. Here transmigration would not be involved. This type of abduction usually occurs when the subject's biology cannot tolerate the transmigration of dimensional movement. (Such as is the case with cattle and most other animal life indigenous to Earth. Some of your reported \u201ccattle mutilations\u201d occurred as a result of this type of experimentation.) There are two primary reasons that \u201calien abductions\u201d occur:",
