  "text": "tic waves and time cycles that we have just outlined, represent the natural hidden dynamics of planetary dimensional ascension and the evolution of conscious- ness through time. An essential part of this process is the relationship between these multidimensional energy mechanics and the operation of the Sphere of Amenti. For the Halls of Amenti to open to the races during the _________________________ 1. Cataclysm occurred 550 million years ago from the perspective of HU-1 Earth time. HU- 2 time cycles are the same amount of time in terms of evolutionary distance covered, but they move twice as fast. D-4 time cycles cover the same block of time in half the number of years it would take to complete that block of time in the D-3 cycle. Thus 550 million years on Earth in the D-3 time cycle represents 225 million years on Tara in the D-4 time cycle. 119",
