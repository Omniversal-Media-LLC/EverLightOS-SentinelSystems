Universal Star Gate- 11 is the Density-4, D-11 Pre-matter gate corresponding to Aveyon, Lyra, the second most powerful Star Gate in the Universal Templar. Members of the Yu race are incarnates of the GA\u2019s D-11 Council of Aveyon , the desig- nated 11th Gate Universal Guardians, and thus Yu races were settled in geo- graphical locations corresponding to Earth\u2019s Star Gate-11 activation and opening points. The Yu races were also settled in other gate areas correspond- ing to Star Gates 2 through 11, that were in need of additional security. The Ur (Urta) races of the Palaidia Empires carried the Universal Master Key and Encryption Codes corresponding to Universal Star Gates 5 through 8 in their 31-36 Strand DNA Templates, and were thus 8 th Gate Universal Guardians. The Ur races are incarnate members of the GA\u2019s D-8 Council of Mintaka-Orion, and were settled in areas of Earth that corresponded to Uni- versal Star Gate-8 and in areas corresponding to Star Gates 5 through 8 that were in need of additional security. The most powerful Universal Star Gates in relation to the operations of planetary, Galactic and Universal systems in our Time Matrix, and thus those most vulnerable to incursion by Fallen Angelic infiltration, are the D-12 Aramatena-Lyra, D-11 Aveyon-Lyra, D-10 Vega-Lyra and D-8 Min",
