The Egyptians carried a special- ized genetic code because of this early morphogenetic manipulation. During the Third Seeding this imprint became even more specialized as portions of the Egyptian line were adopted by the Sixth Race Cloister Melchizedeks, who served as a Host Matrix Family to realign an over-development of Anunnaki genetic coding. Of all the human races to walk the planet, the Egyptians carry the most diversified genetic code. The Melchizedek Egyptians of the Third Seeding orchestrated the Atonist movement about 3,000 years ago, in order to redirect Egyptian culture back toward practice of the Law of One, teachings that had fallen into digression through Anunnaki involvement with Egyptian culture. The Serres were created during the Second Seeding about 945,000 years ago, their Atlanian sub-race morphogenetic field being merged with the Breanoua and Hibiru Cloisters of the fourth and fifth races, which brought the Ayrian and Hibiru lineage into the Atlanian-Egyptian line. This realigned and advanced the genetic blueprint for the Egyptian subrace, creating what would become the primary Egyptian lineage throughout the Third Seeding.
