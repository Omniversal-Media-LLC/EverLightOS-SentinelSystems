The actual cellular codes that serve to store and organize memory become distorted because of this biological distortion. Techniques of \u201cbody talk\u201d may not be successful as the literal biochemical relationships within the body have been \u201cshort circuited.\u201d Mental, emotional and physical abnormalities may result from this, depending upon the degree to which the Keylonta Codes have been altered. In researching and treating cases of abduction, it is important that you learn to distinguish between the types of intrusion, for the appropriate treatment will depend upon the category of abduction. Not only will you need to be able to diagnose the difference between a non-abduction or abduction, and a forced or consented abduction, you will need to know whether the forced abduction involved only cover memories and holographic inserts or whether a forced matrix transplant was attempted or carried out.
