  "text": "Current Events within the low to middle D-4 frequency bands at an accretion level of 3- 3.5 (seventh time continuum). When perceiving your own physical body, and the external objects and activity around it, you are seeing the particle content of your personal mor- phogenetic field, Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field and the Unified Field, as they exist within the low to middle frequency bands of D-3, in the pulsation rhythms of the fifth time continuum, at the 2-2.5-accretion level. You per- ceive these frequency bands as solid while the particle content of your con- sciousness is stationed within the low to middle frequency bands of D-4, in the pulsation rhythms of the seventh time cycle, at a 3-3.5-accretion level. You will perceive the frequency bands of middle to upper D-3, in the pulsa- tion rhythms of the sixth time cycle, at the 2.5\u2014 3 accretion level, as \u201cinner space\u201d, the activity taking place \u201cinside your head and body\u201d, and the atmo- sphere surrounding your body and the Earth, that gives you the perception of space between objects. The illusion of 3-dimensional perception is created through this triad of particle pulsation speeds. The pulsation speed/rhythm of particles is created as energy substance \ufb02ows between fields of particles having different angular rotations of particle spin in relation to each other.
