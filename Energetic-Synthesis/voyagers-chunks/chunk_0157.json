There are many similarities between your Earth reptiles and the original Zeta form, particularly those of the early reptiles that roamed the Earth.) As each successive generation paired they progressively lost the ability to naturally procreate their species. They became genetically neutered. The dimensional merger that they had forced also caused irreparable damage to their planetary structure. They had set in motion the death of their planet and its dimensional counterparts. These events, from the perspective of your time continuum, are occurring in what you would perceive as your future. The Zeta then have \u201cgone back in time\u201d to your time continuum (and others) in hope of finding answers and solutions to their dilemma. Part of their own Time Portal System collapsed because of these events, so they are unable to access their own portals directly. (They cannot thus access the \u201cpast\u201d of their planet before the destruction as they had originally hoped). The Zeta entered your time continuum because of the proximity of Earth's time portals to their own and also because the Earth has certain environmental elements the Zeta need for survival.
