Between one Harmonic Universe and the next there is a 45\u00b0 reverse angular rotation of particle spin. This 45\u00b0 reverse angular rotation of particle spin creates a Magnetic Repulsion Zone, or \u201cvoid\u201d between Harmonic Uni- verses, which keeps the reality fields contained there within separated from each other. These Magnetic Repulsion Zones are what you perceive as the seemingly endless vestiges of outer space. Through this structure of relative angular rotations of particle spin, the holographic illusions of multidimensional reality, matter, time, space, movement and individuation of form are perpetu- ally created and sustained. This will conclude our brief introductory lesson in multidimensional physics; we hope we have provided some interesting ideas for your more courageous scientists to explore. THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT AND SOLAR CRISIS The Philadelphia Experiment 1943 We will now resume our discussion of the Zetas plan to stop the merger of Earth and Tara\u2019s grid and what they did to the Sun in 1943 that almost caused the extinction of the human population on Earth in the 1970s. The Zetas determined that in order to retain control of the human soci- ety within the future space-time coordinates where they had successfully achieved dominion over Tara-Earth\u2019s territorie",
