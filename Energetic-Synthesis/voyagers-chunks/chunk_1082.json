As the 144 incarnates simultaneously evolve with the planet through the six time cycles, the 12- strand DNA imprint is progressively built up in the genetic code. DNA evolves and human consciousness expands as identity evolves with the planet through the Euiago cycles in each Harmonic Universe. The perceptions of your present races are focused within the middle range of the third dimension (the sixth and last time continuum of HU-1), and you perceive the reality of these dimensional bands, from a station of consciousness one dimensional band above. When you perceive the activity that is simultaneously taking place in the lower-dimensional time continua, in the lower levels of Earth's body, that activity appears to you as having taken place in the past. Percep- tion of the other members of your soul family identity, who are stationed in time continua below your own, will appear to you as past life incarnational memory, even though these lifetimes are occurring simultaneously within their own space-time coordinate. Identities stationed in time continua/ Octaves and dimensions/Quadrants ahead of your own, (which in your case would be those in the HU-2 time cycles of Tara), will appear as future life incarnati",
