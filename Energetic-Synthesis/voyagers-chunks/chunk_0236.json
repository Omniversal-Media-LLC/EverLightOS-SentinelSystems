  "text": "The Silicate Matrix The Zionites interacted directly with your ancient Egyptian cultures, and prior to this they were heavily involved with Sumerian culture. Not only were these cultures gifted with knowledge but they were also imbued with the gift of interstellar seeding. Zionites would often interbreed with the humans, adding the potentialities of their genetic code into that of the evolving humans. Certain groups of these \u201cspecial\u201d humans were seeded, and that genetic seed was dispersed among the races through further interbreeding within the twelve human tribes. The Zionites traveled back in time giving to your species the code of transmutation. We refer to this \u201cgenetic package\u201d imbued by the Zionites as the Silicate Matrix or the Crystal Gene. The Silicate Matrix contains the original twelve-strand DNA code structure of the original Taran-human prototype (the Turaneusiam). It presently exists within a number of humans as a latent genetic code sequence that must be brought into activation. Once activated, it allows for the progressive transmutation of form. Not all humans carry this code, and not all code carriers can endure full activation, but those who carry this matrix (contained within the cellular material you currently call junk DNA) have the potential ability of accelerated evolution. They possess within their genetic makeup the latent ability to transmute cellular",
