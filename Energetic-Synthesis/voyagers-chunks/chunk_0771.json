The evolution of planet Earth is intimately connected to that of the planet Tara, which is the original planetary mass out of which Earth emerged. This means that the morphogenetic field of Earth was originally part of the morphogenetic field of Tara (and both were part of Gaia's morphogenetic field). In order for an energy structure to fully ascend through the 15-dimen- sional scale it must assemble all portions of its original morphogenetic imprint. The morphogenetic fields exist as tapestries of inter-woven energy particles, composed of literal substance, and so the process of assembling mor- phogenetic fields into their original pattern is the process of recombining the portions of this energetic tapestry that have become separated from the origi- nal, back into the original form of the energetic tapestry. Planetary ascension is the reuniting of energy units that had been separated into various dimen- sional frequency bands, pulling those energy particles back together by merg- ing the frequencies within which the particles reside. There are natural energy dynamics that govern the m",
