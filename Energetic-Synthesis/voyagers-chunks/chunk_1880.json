This causes the Sphere of Amenti to begin transmitting its morphogenetic imprint for that dimensional frequency band through Earth's grid. The frequency imprints for DNA strands 1 - 8, which are stored within the morphogenetic field of the Sphere of Amenti (along with the imprints for strands 9-12), progressively transmit through Earth's grid, as the dimensional frequency bands that correspond to each strand begin transmission. The frequency bands of D-8 Meta-galactic Core, which accelerate activation of the 8 th DNA strand, tra",
