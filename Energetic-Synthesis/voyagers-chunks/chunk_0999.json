Earth would shift completely out of HU-1 and fully enter the D-4 time cycle, the first 4,426-year cycle of the 26,556-year cycle in HU-2. This natural close of an ascension cycle is called the Doreadeshi. Earth\u2019s natural shift from the HU-1 to the HU-2 time cycles would normally occur in two stages. The overtone particles of Earth shift in the morphogenetic wave at the half-cycle point, and the base-tone particles of Earth shift 2213 years later, in the second morphogenetic wave at the close of the cycle. At that point the full particle base of Earth would be stationed in HU-2, having evolved through dimensional ascension, out of HU-1. The particles composed of overtone frequencies undergo this transformation half- way through the ascension cycle, and the particles composed of base-tone fre- quencies follow suit, 2213 years later, at the end of the ascension cycle. The Sphere of Amenti, Halls of Amenti, the Blue Flame and Human Evolution The complex processes of particle mechanics, morphogenetic waves and time cycles that we have just outlined, represent the natural hidden dynamics of planetary dimensional ascension and the evolution of conscious- ness through time. An essential part of this process is the relationship between these mult",
