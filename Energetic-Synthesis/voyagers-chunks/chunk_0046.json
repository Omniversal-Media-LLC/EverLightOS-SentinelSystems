It is a scientific dynamic known as Particle Transition, a dynamic which is not presently understood within the scientific communities of Earth. Particle Transition is part of the natural evolutionary cycle of planetary bodies and can be understood through advanced applications of Keylontic Morphogenetic Science, as further detailed in the latter portions of this book. In brief, a planet evolves through a fixed multi- dimensional frequency scale, following certain Time Cycles and Time Continua inherent to its dimensional system. In Earth\u2019s evolutionary cycle, a 26,556-year Time Cycle holds six smaller Time Continuum cycles of 4426-years each. Earth\u2019s progression through this fixed structure of time is synchronistically intertwined with the evolutionary cycles of Earth\u2019s anti-particle double/parallel Earth. During the six Time Continuum cycles Earth passes through in its larger 26,556-year evolutionary cycle, Earth and its double literally trade places. Our particle Earth spends two Time Continuum cycles within the anti- particle universe, while during the same period, parallel anti-particle Earth spends two continuum cycles in the particle universe. (This is done through complex dynamics involving the reversal of",
