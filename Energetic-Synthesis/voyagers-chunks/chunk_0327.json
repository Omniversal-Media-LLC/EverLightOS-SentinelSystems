But the Sirians, on behalf of the Taran Turaneusiam from the first experiment, who had evolved well in other systems, requested that instead of ending the strain the Breneau assist them once more in redirecting the strain into a more productive pattern of evolution. Many in the multidimensional structures petitioned for this intervention, and so the Breneau agreed to work with them in cultivating a species that possessed greater potentials. The Breneau made further agreements with certain Soul Matrix families that existed in dimensions more closely related to the Breneau. These groups were asked to join the experiment taking place on Earth and to assist in restructuring the genetic imprint of the species. These groups entered into different time coordinates within the Earth structure and began seeding a higher mutation of the genetic code. These groups were used as the catalyst for matrix transplant. Large numbers of humans were led, through holographic inserts into training programs that would allow for the development of intellect and greater self awareness. Many of these early humans had already digressed to the point where their original Soul Matrices had become fragmented and cut off from the Time Matrix grid. In order for these beings to evolve out of their digression, a matrix transplant was used to \u201cre-power\u201d",
