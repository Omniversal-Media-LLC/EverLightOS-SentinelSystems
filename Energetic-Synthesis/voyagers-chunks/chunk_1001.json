The Sphere of Amenti must descend through the Arc into Earth\u2019s D-2 core, and the Sphere must have its 12-year period of disbursing its frequencies through the Earth grid, before the grids of Earth and Tara begin to intersect five years prior to the half-point. The Blue Flame Staff of Amenti, Earth\u2019s portion of Tara\u2019s D-5 morphogenetic field, allows Earth\u2019s grid to merge with Tara\u2019s in D-4. If the Blue Flame is not embodied on Earth when the grids begin to intersect, the infusion of D-5 energy from Tara\u2019 s grid and the Holo- graphic Beam cannot run through Earth\u2019 s grid during the crest of the morphogenetic wave. In such a case the Earth\u2019s grid cannot link with Tara\u2019s to receive the energy infusion, so Tara\u2019s grid will link with whatever planetary core the Blue Flame is stored within. The fifth-dimensional energy infusion would then pass down from that planet, through the energy spiral of the Holographic Beam and remain within the overtone particles of Earth, unable to pass into Earth\u2019s base-tone particles and grid. In this case Earth and the races would be trapped for another 26,556 years within HU-1, the mass assembly of the fifth DNA strand would not occur, and the majority of Earth\u2019s people wou",
