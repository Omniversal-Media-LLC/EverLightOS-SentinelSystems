We transmit our communications through the interdimensional portals then \u201cfine-tune\u201d our transmission through the time-portals into your time-space coordinates. We are able to transmit large amounts of data into a vast area in this manner. This information is then translated to your level of perception through those individuals whose bodies have the ability to pick up and synthesize advanced (compared to the average operational frequencies of your present time) electrical impulse patterns. All of you have translation abilities to some degree, but some of you are more genetically predisposed to this ability. Our communications come to you from another dimension, through a time-portal system of an Earth that exists parallel to your own. Our culture lives within that parallel system, but in its own time-portal frame it is placed within the future of even that Earth version. These Keylonta transmissions, coming from this distant place, will reach those in various dimensions and time coordinates who are ready to translate them. These communications will become available to those who are in need of the knowledge contained within them. It is our hope that if you can become aware of Keylonta mechanics enough of you will be enab",
