  "text": "ere Planetary Shield distortions exist, the molecular structure of Earth\u2019s plates experiences weakened resistance and less flexibility from this nucleic stress. The climatic/weather patterns in such areas become less stable, and the tectonic plates become vulnerable to seismic activity. Each of the natural 12 Planetary Seals releases a progressively higher- dimensional frequency spectrum into Earth\u2019s Shields, thus exerting a progressively increasing amount of nucleic stress within Earth\u2019s tectonic plates, which is difficult enough to contend with in areas of Planetary Shields distortions without adding the unnatural \u201cSeven Jehovian Seals\u201d to the mess, which spells ''pending crisis''\u2014a crisis the Emerald Covenant nations are presently trying desperately to avoid via remote frequency transmission into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields. Without assistance from Human and Indigo Children in \u201canchoring\u201d these frequencies into Earth\u2019s Shields via Rainbow Roundtables (RRTs) and Masters Planetary Merkaba Mechanics, Guardian efforts to prevent this crisis would fail. 427",
