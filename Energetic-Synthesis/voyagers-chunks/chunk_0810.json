During the dimensional blend the Blue Flame could not directly enter the Sphere of Amenti as the Sphere would be connected to the Earth's morphogenetic field at D-2. The Inner Earth portals to D-2 open during the dimensional blending period, and if the fifth-dimensional frequencies of the Blue Flame merged directly with the second-dimensional frequencies of Earth's core, Earth's planetary grid would explode. The fifth-dimensional fre- quencies had to be dispersed through the Earth grid, via the energetic fields of certain people alive on the planet. The bio-energetic fields of those individu- als would serve as frequency modulators for the fifth-dimensional energy. These individuals would hold the D-5 frequency of the Blue Flame within 53",
