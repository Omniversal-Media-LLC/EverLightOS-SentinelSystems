The process operates within the human auric field, DNA and body in the same way that it occurs within the Earth\u2019s auric field and particle body. The first personal Stellar Activation occurs when the fourth DNA strand begins to assemble (the fourth strand begins to assemble when the personal morphogenetic field is at a 3-accretion level\u2014all of the frequency bands of D-1 through D-3 have been drawn into the morphogenetic field.) When half of the fourth DNA strand is assembled (accretion level 3.5\u2014all of dimen- sional frequency bands one through three and one-half of the fourth-dimen- sional frequency bands, are drawn into the morphogenetic field) the first Stellar Wave Infusion begins within the human auric field and body. By the end of the first Stellar Activation, the first level of the D-1 etheric body auric capsule dissolves and its particles expand into the D-4 astral cap- sule and increase their pulsation rhythm to that of the D-4 time cycle. As each Stellar Activation and Wave Infusion continues, the HU-1 dimensional auric capsules progressively dissolve and the particles pass into the HU-2 auric capsules, then the HU-2 particles expand into the HU-3 auric capsules in like fashion. The auric level separations within the human auric field p",
