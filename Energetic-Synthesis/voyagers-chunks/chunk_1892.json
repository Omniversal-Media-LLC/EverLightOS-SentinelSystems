Tara is Earth in the future space-time coordinates of the Har- monic Universe-2 time cycles. Transfer to Tara represents a 5532.5-year time- travel journey into the future. Humans teleporting/time-traveling to Tara are called V oyagers. \u2022 V oyagers will experience subtle or direct contact by other V oyagers, ET or metaterrestrial guardian groups prior to the ascension period, through which they will receive training & make travel arrangements. V oyagers must complete a minimum of two Stellar Activations to biologically tolerate trans- port to Tara. V oyagers who are near 5 DNA strand assembly but assembly is not quite complete cannot pass through Amenti directly. They will be pri- vately escorted to guardian Transport landing sites & will travel to Tara via interdimensional spacecraft. \u2022 Once arriving on Tara V oyagers will be given lodging & will attend ori- entation classes to assist them",
