The human was intended to become a sentient, self-motivated being, capable of choice and conscious co-creation with the Soul Matrix, rather than an \u201cunthinking\u201d extension of the Soul Matrix. So in those early times the instinctual response of emotional cognition was partially \u201cdismantled.\u201d This involved de-activating certain Keylonta Codes within the DNA pattern, which created a sense of separation from soul for the developing human. The separation allowed for a clearer focus in time and matter, through which the intellect could evolve and from which individualized identity emerged. As with many of the other disengaged codes (those from the original Soul Matrices that existed prior to the Host Matrix transplants) these \u201cinstinctual emotive\u201d codes were stored within the cellular pattern and the Soul Matrix. A small portion of them were left in operation, giving the human access to small amounts of Soul Matrix data and serving to provide enough instinctual basis to ensure appropriate action in regard to survival of the organism. These remaining codes became the basis for your \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d biochemical reaction response. The stored emotive codes, along with others, were kept with the human within the cellular structure, so as the organism evolved those codes could once a",
