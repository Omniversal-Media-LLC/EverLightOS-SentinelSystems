  "text": "s D-1 overtone particle base will have completed its shift into the pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time cycle and Earth\u2019s D-1 base tone particles enter D-3 pulsation rhythm. As Earth\u2019s D-l Merkaba Field opens into Tara's D-4 Merkaba Field, the particle pulsation speed of Earth\u2019s core begins to rise into that of the D-4 frequency bands. By the end of its Solar Activation in 6/2004, Earth will complete 1/3 of its shift into the HU-2 time cycles, in preparation for merger with Tara on 5/5/2012. During Earth\u2019s second D-5 Pleiadian Activation Earth\u2019s D-2 and D-3 par- ticle base will also rise into the pulsation rhythms of HU-2 time cycles, 204",
