The human biology is not designed to assimilate such an onslaught of inconsistent electrical data and will be biologically unable to process the memory fragments into a coherent focus of identity in time. Should the unenlightened Zeta plan from the old agenda reach fulfillment your populace would literally be robbed of its individual and collective memory, creating \u201cbiological puppets\u201d that the Zeta could program in any way they choose.
