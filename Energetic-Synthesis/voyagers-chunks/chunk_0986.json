  "text": "The Holographic Beam up through the 15-dimensional scale. This opening of interdimensional por- tals, which creates the morphogenetic wave, allows a beam of UHF energy to pass from the Meta-galactic Core in D-8, through all of the Harmonic Uni- verses. We refer to this as the Holographic Beam, for it is the primary spiral of transmitting energy that feeds and sustains all of the dimensional systems and the holograms of matter which take place in those systems. The path of the Holographic Beam follows a particular route into the time cycles of HU- 1. lt spirals down through various planetary cores from HU-2 and HU-3, through the planetary core of Alcyone in the Pleiades, through various other planets and then enters your solar system through the core of the sun. From there the Holographic Beam moves outward and through the cores of the planets in your solar system. As the planets move within the cycles of their orbits, at certain points they align with the sun in a particular way, and pass through the projection of this Holographic Beam. The Holographic Beam is released when the portals open during the half-point of the ascension cycle and again at the close of the ascension cycle 2213 years later. The Holographic Beam that was released during the ascen~ sion cycle at the end of the previous 26,556-year period leaves its trace within the HU-1 galaxy. The beam from the past cycle",
