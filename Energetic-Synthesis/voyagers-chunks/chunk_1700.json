From this center point, each \u201chead\u201d extends as a pillar, two running horizontally east/west, one above and one below the equator, and two running vertically north/south, one on each side of the Greenwich Meridian. The \u201cfour Pillars of the Faces of Man\u201d intersect again, where the \u201cfront tops of their heads\u201d connect at Longitude 180\u00b0 E-W and Latitude 0\u00b0, near Howland Island in the Equatorial Center Pacific Ocean. (See APIN diagrams pp. 527-530.) Though Fallen Angelics have made numerous attempts at compromising the four Faces of Man LPIN system since its installation in 22,500 BC, none have succeeded in \u201ccracking its coding.\u201d The four Faces of Man LPIN runs on what is called the Khundaray/Kee-Ra-ShA Primal Life Force Currents from dimensions 13-14-15 and the Trans-Harmonic \u201cTrion\u201d Currents from beyond this Time Matrix. These powerful interstellar frequencies are far beyond the range and power of those accessible to Fallen Angelic races. Once brought into critical mass activation, through Humans and Indigos running \u201cTri-Veca Rainbow Roundtables,\u201d the four Faces of Man and Guardians",
