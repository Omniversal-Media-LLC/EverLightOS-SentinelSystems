They were a brown race that appeared about 15 million years ago, who were assigned to assembling the second strand of DNA. Following the Lumari- ans and their seven sub-races and 49 families was the Second infusion of the Breanoua Cloistered race and their five subraces and 25 families. They entered through the peoples of their first incarnational wave about 12 million years ago. Entering through the peoples of the Breanoua Cloister came the Fourth Root Race, the Alanians and their sub-races and families. The Alanians appeared about nine million years ago, a red skinned race, who were responsible for assembling DNA strand #3. The five Cloister Races and the Lumarian and Alanian Root Races evolved together on Earth between 25 million to 5.5 mil- lion years ago, developing high culture and much diversification. Incarnates who kept the integrity of their genetic code transmuted through each of the races then ascended within their immortal bodies through the Halls of Amenti. This period in time is known as The First Seeding, and represents the Third World in Native American tradition.
