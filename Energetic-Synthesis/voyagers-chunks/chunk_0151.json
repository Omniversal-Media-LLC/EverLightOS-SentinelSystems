  "text": "dimension. Their sciences are built upon this knowledge, and thus there is much humankind could learn from the Zeta. The Zeta possess physically solid three-dimensional vessels, but only the smallest ones have ever approached Earth's atmosphere. However, as they know the mechanics of the Time Portal System they are able to place their vessels just outside of the frequency bands that constitute your three-dimensional system. They are able to establish \u201cholding patterns\u201d between dimensions and thus can become invisible to your system at will. The Zeta also have the ability to use the Dimensional Lock System to some degree and are able to appear in some of the adjacent dimensions. But the Zeta originate from your three-dimensional system in a different time continuum than your present reality. Though possessing knowledge far superior to your own, the Zeta do not have a full understanding of the Dimensional Lock System, nor have they mastered the Time Portal Systems of adjacent dimensions. Both humans and the Zeta have much to learn.",
