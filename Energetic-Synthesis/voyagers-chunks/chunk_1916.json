The human Crystal Body encompasses 12 dimensions of identity, sound frequency and light spectra and sets the structure for the bio-energetic chakra system, auric field and electromagnetic Merkaba Fields (counter-rotating spirals of multidimensional electromagnetic energy through which the auric field is formed). The Crystal Body represents the collective \ufb01fth state of being between pure con- sciousness and form manifestation, in relation to an individuated construction of consciousness or matter. Through the Crystal Body the electromagnetic Merk- aba Fields of a form are designed and constructed. The Merkaba Fields represent the sixth state of being between pure conscious- ness and form manifestation. Through the counter rotating electromagnetic fields of the Merkaba Fields the contours for the bio-energetic auric field and chakra system are formed in accordance with the design set by the Crystal Body. The bio-energetic auric \ufb01eld and chakra systems represent the seventh state of being between consciousness and manifestation. The bio-energetic field then serves to direct Partiki units from the Dimensional Unified Fields into parti- cle or ant",
