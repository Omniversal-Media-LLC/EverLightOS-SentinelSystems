In like fashion, Tara can be viewed as Earth\u2019s soul and Gaia as Earth\u2019s Over-soul. There are also versions of each planet and person that exist as non-matter energy forms within HU-4 and HU-5. Each planet and person is connected to each of the seven lower-dimen- sional fields by a minute crystalline pattern of frequency that represents one- dimensional level of the personal or planetary morphogenetic field. This minute crystalline structure is called a Morphogenetic Seed Crystal; it serves to keep the multidimensional aspects of the identity connected to each other and to the primary morphogenetic imprint within the D-8 Meta-galactic Core. There are 15 Morphogenetic Seed Crystals within the morphogenetic structure of a planet or person, one corresponding to each of the 15 dimen- sions. The Seed Crystals serve as seals that keep the morphogenetic field sep- arated and locked into each dimensional band; thus we refer to them as Seed Crystal Seals. The Seed Crystal Seals control the speed at which fourth- dimensional Merkaba Fields will rotate, and so direct the pulsation rhythm of particles within each dimension. Along with the Seed Crystal Se",
