As each cycle of human race evolution entered manifestation on Earth, more of the Christos Tem- plate would be progressively anchored and integrated into Earth\u2019s Manifesta- tion Template. When the Cycle of the Rounds was completed, and all portions of the 12-Tribes Angelic Human races were in position on planet, a final Stellar Activations Cycle would allow the Angelic Human races to fully anchor the D- 12 Planetary Christos Blueprint in Earth\u2019s Template. In com- pletion of the Angelic Human Mission, the D-12 Maharic Shield of Aramat- ena Planetary Christos Blueprint would be simultaneously anchored in various interrelated Time Vectors and Time Cycles of Earth-Tara-Gaia. At this time, the Planetary Shields would fully realign to their natural D-12 order, allowing the planet to self-sustain a permanent, natural D-12 Christos Alignment. When the full frequency spectrum of the D-12 Shield of Aramatena Template Christos Blueprint is anchored in Earth\u2019s Template \u201cat one time\u201d, during a Stellar Activation Cycle when the natural planetary, galactic and universal Star Gates open, the Earth-Tara-Gaia Planetary Shields can hold the full D-12 Maharata Cre",
