Earth Begins and Completes D-7 Arc- turian, D-8 Orion and D-9 Andromeda Activations and the Silver Wave and Blue-black and Silver-black Liquid Light Wave Infusions. The Grids of Earth And Tara are in Full Alignment and Earth is Centered within Holographic Beam and Photon Belt. The Keepers of the Blue and Violet Flames Complete their D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core Activations and Silver-black Liquid Light Wave Infusions. Earth comes into direct alignment with the Holographic Beam, Earth\u2019s overtone particles are fully immersed within the Photon Belt, the grids of Earth and Tara are in full alignment, and the planetary cores of Earth, Tara and Gaia come into direct alignment with each other and the Meta- galactic Core, for a period of three days. As Earth aligns with the Holo- graphic Beam, the D-9 Andromeda/Galactic Core morphogenetic field, D-8 Orion/Meta-Galactic Core and D-7 Arcturian Spirals align with the D-6 Sirian, D-5 Pleiadian-Alcyone, D-4 Solar Spirals and Earth\u2019s Merkaba Fields. During this Three-day particle conversion period Earth begins and com- pletes its three remaining Transmutative Stellar Wave Activations and Earth\u2019s core receives a rapid sequence of three Stellar Wave Infusions. On day one of the 3-day period Earth begins and completes its D-7 Arcturian Activation, as the D-7 Arcturian",
