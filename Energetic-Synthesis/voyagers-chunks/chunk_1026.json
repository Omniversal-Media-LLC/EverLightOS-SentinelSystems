When viewed from the vibration level of the third dimension, which is where your consciousness and instruments are pres- ently focused, the D-1 Merkaba Fields, which exist within the core of Earth and the local planets, and which are within the core of the Sun, appear to be located outside of the planets, many miles away in outer space. You are dealing with multi-layered reality fields that take place in the same space, but appear to be separated due to the relationship between particle pulsation rhythm and angular rotation of particle spin. The perceivable experience of movement, passing time, matter, space, distance between objects and separation of forms is an illusion created by the multidimensional, holographic refraction of particles and anti-particles, which pulsate and spin at varying speeds and angular rotations in relation to each other. The movement of particles itself is a holographic illusion; movement only appears to be such when consciousness views itself through the layered prisms of multidimensional order. It will be centuries before your scientists begin to comprehend these facts of reality construction. However, while your con- sciousness is focused within the multiple layers of dimensional reality, the concepts of space, time, matter a",
