  "text": "s. The pulsation speed/rhythm of particles is created as energy substance \ufb02ows between fields of particles having different angular rotations of particle spin in relation to each other. The 3-dimensional human consciousness and the 3-dimensional body of the Earth consciousness are made of particles that pulsate at three different rhythms, and which exist at three different positions of angular rotation. These particle fields make up three levels of Merkaba Fields within and through which physically apparent manifestation occurs. There is a 90\u00b0 shift in angular rotation of particle spin between the three Merkaba Fields, between the three levels of human con- sciousness, and between the three levels of Earth\u2019s particle body. The three levels of the personal body and the Earth\u2019s body represent three different time continua, or Octaves, through which frequency bands from the dimensional Unified Fields are pulled/accreted into the personal morphogenetic field and that of the Earth. These three particle pulsation rhythms are synchronized, and through this dance of particle spin and pulsation, personal consciousness evolves with the Earth upward through the time cycles of the 15-dimensional scale, progressively expanding and raising the level of accretion. The level of frequencies accreted into the personal morphogenetic \ufb01eld will determine the level of DNA strand assembly you possess",
