Yanas collectives from each of the 3 Primal Sound Fields of the Khundaray (Energy Matrix) are collectively called the Eieyani (pronounced \u201cE-yon\u2019-E\u201d), or the Eieyani Council, both meaning \u201cof the Yanas.\u201d The Eieyani collective responsible for seeding life into our Time Matrix is called the Melchizedek Cloister Eieyani or MC Eyeiani. The Yanas exist beyond the smaller reality fields within which space-time-matter experience takes place; occasionally they incarnate in various forms, into the fields of space-time-matter within the Density Levels of our Time Matrix, to fulfill universal service missions. When in physical incarnation in time, incarnate Yanas most often use the name Eieyani in reference to their family line; in contemporary times, the Eieyani incarnate on Earth are commonly referred to as \u201cType-1 Grail Line Indigo Children.\u201d The Eieyani collectives of the Khundaray Primal Sound Fields are the Eternal Guardian Collectives that are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the Energy Matrix and Time Matrix systems within them, and for seeding \u201clife-waves\u201d into manifest Time Matrices. The Yanas Collectives of the Primal Sound Fields represent our \u201cCosmic Family of Consciousness,\u201d through which all manifest things are indelibly connected to Source through the energetic expression of the Primal Sound Fields.
