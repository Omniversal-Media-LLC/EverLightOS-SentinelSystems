Earth\u2019s base tone magnetic fields temporarily collapse and Earth\u2019s particles and Tara\u2019s anti-particles slow in pulsation, in preparation for the return to their original polarity and angular rotation of spin. The Earth's electrical overtone particles, which were in hyper-space, re-manifest as magnetic base tone anti-particles in Tara\u2019s grid. Tara\u2019s magnetic base tone anti-particles return from hyper-space and re-manifest as electrical over- tone particles in Gaia\u2019s grid. As this occurs, the base tone particles of Earth and the overtone anti-particles of Tara reverse their polarity, return- ing to their original orientation. Usually, at this point in the particle con- version process, the particles and anti-particles would normally reverse the 45\u00b0 shift in angular rotation of spin that began on 12/21/2012. The particles of Earth and anti-particles of Tara would begin re-orientation into the pulsation rhythms of their original time cycles. At this phase of the particle conversion process the Bridge Zone comes into play. The base tone particles of Earth, that would normally slow in pulsation rhythm and return to the D-3 time cycle, will instead be divided into two groups. Through beaming a continual stream of D-3.5 energy through Earth\u2019s core and grid via the Holographic",
