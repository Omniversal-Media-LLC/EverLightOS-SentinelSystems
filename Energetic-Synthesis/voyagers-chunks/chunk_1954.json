When this alignment of spiraling EM Merkaba Fields occurs, Earth has the opportunity to raise the pulsation speed of its particle base into that of higher-dimensional time cycles. At these times interdimensional portals/passageways between Harmonic Universes, dimen- sional bands and time cycles open and a planet or person can ascend into the planetary systems of higher-dimensional time cycles or out-of-form manifes- tation. The pathway of multidimensional, inter-stellar Merkaba Field spiral alignment runs from the higher-dimensional fields of D-10 Lyra-Andromeda, through D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core, D-8 Orion-Meta-galactic Core, D-7 Arcturus, D-6 Sirius, D-5 Pleiades-Alcyone and into the D-4 Solar Merkaba Field spiral, then down into the D-3/D-2/D-1 Merkaba Fields of Earth. Each of these inter-stellar dimensional Merkaba Field spirals is referred to as a Stel- lar Spiral. Each Stellar Spiral bears the name of the star system through which it flows and carries within its energy field the light spectra and fre- quency bands embodied within that star system. Earth is now approaching the alignment of the Stellar Spiral Bridge that runs from D-9 Andromeda down through the D-4 Solar Spiral to Earth. Earth\u2019s alignment with each spiral of the Stellar Spiral Bridge occurs in six phases, beginning with the D-4 Solar Spiral",
