The Labyrinth Group also knows that the \u201cCentral Race\u201d Elohei and Angelic Humans will not support their efforts of creating the BeaST weapon, but the Corteum have convinced the Labyrinth Group that the invasion cannot be prevented using peaceful methods. The Corteum and UIR are very interested in the Ancient Arrow site, as hidden within this area is the very tool by which Emerald Covenant nations can prevent the 2011 UIR/Corteum Invasion. _________________________________ 8. scalar-wave sequences. 9.
