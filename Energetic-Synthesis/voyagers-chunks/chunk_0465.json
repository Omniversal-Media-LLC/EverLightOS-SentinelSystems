  "text": "ers of this \u201calphabet\u201d are stored within every cell of every human; it is the basis for the human genetic code. Through this \u201ccellular alphabet\u201d impulses of electromagnetic energy are aligned and ordered, much as words are formed out of the different letter combinations of your written alphabet. The words, created out of the alphabet of letters, are conveyors of meaning. The words and the alphabet themselves are not the meaning but serve as a conduit through which meaning can be moved from one place to another. The alphabet then represents a tool, which creates a medium through which ideas and perceptions can be shared or projected. Now, in terms of your cellular alphabet, it too serves as a tool and conveyor of meaning. The Fire Letters represent fixed electromagnetic codes (patterns of sequentially arranged electromagnetic impulses) that can be arranged in many ways to form \u201cwords,\u201d or electromagnetic code patterns, that can potentially carry a wide variety of meanings when put together in specific ways. Just as a written alphabet holds the potential to convey very simple meanings or more complex ideas, so does the cellular alphabet have the potential to convey simple or complex meanings. The cellular alphabet is designed in a way that allows for many \u201csentences\u201d to be created at once. The electromagnetic codes can be arranged in numerous ways",
