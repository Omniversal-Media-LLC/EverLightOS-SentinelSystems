As this energy is released, the particles carrying overtone frequencies begin merging with Tara\u2019s anti-particles carrying base-tone frequencies. As Earth\u2019s particles and Tara\u2019s anti-particles progres- sively merge, they enter hyper-space and transmute into their respective dimensional morphogenetic fields. This particle/anti-particle transmutation progressively accelerates, as the energetic grids of Earth and Tara come into alignment, transmuting more and more overtone particles and base-tone anti-particles into the morphogenetic fields. The progressive transmutation of particles and anti-particles creates a building wave of energy moving from Earth and Tara, into the higher-dimen- sional morphogenetic fields. And like the undertow of a tide, this energy wave creates a back\ufb02ow energy wave, from the morphogenetic fields, through which Earth\u2019s overtone particles re-manifest as Tara\u2019s base-tone anti-particles and Tara\u2019s base-tone anti-particles re-manifest as Gaia\u2019s particles. The height of the process occurs when the grids of Earth and Tara come into full alignment at the half-point in the cycle, at which time the morpho- genetic wave fully crests, and the grids of Earth and Tara begin pulling away from each other. The crest of the m",
