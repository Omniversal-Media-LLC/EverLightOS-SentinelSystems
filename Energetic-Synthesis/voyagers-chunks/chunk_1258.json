The experiment resembles the Philadelphia Experiment of 1943 and the Montauk Project of 1983. The Resistance\u2019s covert moti- vation for the 2003 experiment is to create a rip in space-time that will connect with space-time rips that were made during the experiments in 1943 and 1983, so they may cloak large numbers of spacecraft while bring- ing them into underground bases. The presence of these underground fleets at three different time intervals, is necessary for the Resistance to broadcast the EM pulses of their intended Frequency Fence. If the Interior Government and world military organizations can be convinced to stop any such dimensional blending experiments, especially during the months of July through October of 2003, the Frequency Fence agenda will be abandoned. 12. Spring 2004: Dracos-Zeta Resistance to Begin EM Pulses of Frequency Fence. If the Dracos-Zeta Resistance is successful in motivating the 2003 experi- ment and the Earth\u2019s grid is not yet at 3.75 accretion, they intend to begin broadcasting the base EM pulses of the Frequency Fence, from several underground base locations. The Resistance will have introduced an undetectable organic element to mass water supplies by this time, which is needed to repress the human body\u2019s natural immuno",
