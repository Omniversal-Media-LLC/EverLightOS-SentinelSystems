When the polarity of Earth\u2019s particle base is reversed, Earth\u2019s magnetic poles spin, reverse and shift 45\u00b0 in their angle of rotation, and the Earth enters the faster moving parallel time cycle in the HU-1 anti-particle universe. As this occurs during the five-year cresting of the morphogenetic wave, Tara\u2019s anti-particles are also going through a pole reversal and time cycle shift. The electrical fields in Tara\u2019s grid spin, reverse and shift 45\u00b0, and anti-particle Tara shifts into the parallel time cycle in the HU-2 particle universe. The particle pulsation rate of Earth\u2019s parallel, anti-particle time cycle in HU-1 is twice the speed of the same cycle in the HU-1 particle universe. The particle pulsation rate of Tara\u2019s HU-2 particle time cycle is also twice the speed of Earth\u2019s particle time cycle. When anti-particle Tara enters its paral- lel particle time cycle in HU-2, and particle Earth enters its parallel anti-par- ticle time cycle in HU-1, the two planetary grids are entering the same particle pulsation rate and thus the same time cycle. Base-tone particle Earth and overtone anti-particle Tara temporarily merge in the dimensional fre- quency bands of D-4. As long as the electromagnetic fields of both planets are in balance, this sim",
