If your fourth DNA strand is fully assembled, you will have an accretion level of 4, your consciousness will be stationed in lower D-5 and you will perceive thought-forms and energy patterns existing within the lower D-4 frequency bands as physically manifest, external events. These thought-forms are the energy patterns left behind by you and the masses, when your consciousness was stationed in lower D-4, when you were assembling the fourth DNA strand. Presently, most humans do not have more than a 3.5-accretion level, a low to middle fourth-dimensional focus of consciousness. This level of con- sciousness corresponds to 3.5 strands of activated DNA, which only allows the consciousness to perceive thought patterns/energy patterns of objects and events from the low to middle frequency bands of D-3 as physical reality. The frequency fields of D-1 are below the range of D-4 perception and appear as inner darkness. The lower frequency fields of D-2 appear as past memories. The middle to upper frequency fields of D-3 appear as internal mental/per- ceptual events and thought-forms, and as Earth\u2019s atmosphere and the space between objects, from D-4 perception. The reality fields of middle to upper",
