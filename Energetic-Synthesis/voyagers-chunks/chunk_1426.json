The two Mixed Cloister races of Inner Earth with which the Urtite- Tri-Cloister Maji genome is combined are races of the Inner Earth regions that received genetic enhancement from the Sirius B Maharaji blue humans following their exile to Inner Earth during the Thousands Years War of 846,800 BC (see Page 43). Previous to this genetic acceleration, Inner Earth Shambali and Bhrama Mixed Cloister races had emerged into Inner Earth from 12-Tribes Seeding-1 during the Electric Wars of 5,498,000 BC (see Page 18). They were originally members of the 12-Strand DNA Template Christiac Grail Line Angelic Human Cloister race lines of Seeding-1. Exiled Shambali and Bhrama races of Seeding-2 integrated into their related Inner Earth cultures exiled from Seeding-1, then received further genetic accelera- tion from the Maharaji blue human Christiac-Rishic Grail Line race of Sirius B. Following this genetic acceleration, which was obtained through consen- sual intermarrying of family lines from Shambali and Bhrama races with Maharaji blue human family lines residing in Inner Earth, the Mixed Cloister Shambali and Bhrama race lines evolved into 24-48 Strand Christiac-Rishic DNA Templates. This genetic enhancement allowed them to serve as the two primary guardian races for the C",
