These inserts, however, can be felt, sensed through the emotional and intuitive facility, and can be detected through the use of Higher Sensory Perception (\u201cHSP\u201d). HSP involves using the seven senses of the human organism that exist at a higher frequency than the five identified senses with which you are familiar. Because these sense facilities themselves exist within the higher-frequency bands of the human bioenergetic field, they are able to bring in and translate (through the Keylonta Codes) higher frequency data (some can translate ultra-low frequency also). The energy that links the human to its Soul Matrix is high frequency energy. The \u201chigher\u201d senses of HSP are the facilities used to translate Soul Matrix information, through the body, into the human awareness. Holographic inserts are \u201cbroadcast\u201d within a certain frequency range (in your case, the range of the average, or mean, of the five-sense human perceptual range) outside of which the \u201cmatter illusion\u201d of the hologram begins to deteriorate. To create mass holographic inserts the Zeta have to create a frequency fence (by manipulating the Keylonta Codes within the human DNA using sound) that \u201cblocks out\u201d the higher and lower frequency bands, \u201csealing in\u201d the human perce",
