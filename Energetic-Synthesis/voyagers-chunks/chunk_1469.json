If the Cycle of the Rounds had proceeded without progressive Fallen Angelic interference, the four Rounds of the Angelic Human lineage would have fully anchored the D-12 Shield of Aramatena and completed the Christos Realignment Mission on Earth long ago. The Fourth Round of Angelic Human evolution is still in progress from a present-day earthly stand-point, as two of the five Root Races and one of the five Cloister Races have not yet entered their birthing cycles on contemporary Earth. In truth, these \u201cnot yet manifested\u201d Fourth-Round Angelic Human race strains already exist and are evolving within higher frequency Density-2 Time Vectors of Earth, that represent a \u201cfuture time\u201d Time Cycle of Density-2 Tara in rela- tion to the position of races in contemporary 21st Century Density-1 Earth. In the same fashion, the evolutionary Rounds of the Palaidia Urtite-Clois- ter, Urtite-Cloister, Cloister and \u201c earlier\u201d Root Races are also occurring concurrently with contemporary human evolution, in both higher and lower-frequency Density-1 Time Vectors of Earth. The design of the Cycle of the Rounds Angelic Human Evolutionary Blueprint re\ufb02ects the reality of physics upon which space-time-matter mani- festation is built; time is simultaneous. Time Cycl",
