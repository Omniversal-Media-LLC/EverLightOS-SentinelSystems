  "text": "What Others Are Saying About Voyagers I\u2026 \u201cThe X Files is nothing compared to this book. It fell into my lap at the perfect moment, when I was discovering a subconscious part of me that had experienced alien abductions since a young child. Up until the year 2000 I had denied such things were possible. \u201cNow my life, especially my nights, were filled with a penetrating fear, not knowing if tonight would involve another unwelcome visit. \u201cThis book brought back the light into these night terrors, where I now understand the mystery and know how to deal with frequency fences (illusions of reality) that are projected into my mind. \u201cIf you believe/know you are part of this mysterious adventure, this is the survival book to claim back your power and face your fears!\u201d \u2014 A transfixed reader",
