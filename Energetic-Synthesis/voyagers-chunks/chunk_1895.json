Over several generations this mutation will cause break down of the genetic code and the inability to reproduce. \u2022 Descending Humans will no longer be able to access multidimensional awareness and will be unable to ascend out of HU-1 after death or reincar- nate without a Host Matrix Transplant. Without an energetic link to a Soul Matrix the consciousness becomes finite and will eventually fragment into the Unified Field of HU-1 as undifferentiated units of consciousness. \u2022 Experientially, Descending Humans will face some degree of Earth changes, an acceleration of disease & deterioration during the ascension period and will find that portions of Earth\u2019s populations have literally van- ished without a trace following 2017. \u2022 Earth\u2019s primary particle base and morphogenetic field will transfer to the Bridge Zone, D-3 Earth will represent the Phantom particle base left over from Earth's transition & will become a Descending Planet, unable to evolve out of the HU-1 time cycles. \u2022 This is the least favorable path, with far reaching evolutionary conse- quences, but will be experienced by large numbers of the population if they do not rapidly awaken & take responsibility for conscious evolution. 448",
