They are the ener- getic substances, through which the base electro-magnetism that keeps the universe and parallel universe in motion is manufactured. Each Partiki perpetually breaks down into Particum and Partika, particle and anti-particle, while simultaneously replicating the original Partiki, through the act of internal fission. The replication serves to retain the pat- tern of the original, while the Particum and Partika serve to draw other Par- tiki units from the Unifi ed Field. The Particum and Partika are then magnetically drawn back together in an act of fusion, through which they merge with the replica of the original Partiki out of which they were created. During fusion the Particum and Partika draw new energy patterns in the form of Partiki units back into the morphogenetic structure of the original Partiki, which expands the original pattern while retaining its organic integrity. Through this process crystalline composite forms are created, which serve as the morphogenetic blueprints through which individuated forms and identity will manifest. The Partika perpetually circulate energy from the original Partiki through the Cosmic Matrix and the Particum perpetually draw energy from the Unified Field of the Cosmic Matrix back into the morphogenetic form of the Partiki, expanding its ori",
