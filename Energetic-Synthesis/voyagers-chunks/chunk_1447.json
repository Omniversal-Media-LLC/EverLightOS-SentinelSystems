Through understanding the design and purpose through which the Palaidia Races were seeded also reveals the intrinsic design and hidden purpose behind and within humanity\u2019s genetic evolution, and where within this greater evolutionary design our contemporary human culture fits. The five Palaidia Races were seeded in precise locations on Earth that corresponded directly to the locations of Earth\u2019s 12 Templar Cue Sites (see page 269). Earth\u2019s 12 Templar Cue Sites mark the surface Earth locations of the 12 Inner Earth Star Gates and Crystal Pylon Temples, through which the opening of surface Earth\u2019s 12 Primary Templar Signet Site star gates could be manually directed. Not only were the five Palaidia Races distributed among Earth\u2019s 12 Templar Cue Sites, they were distributed with precision. The DNA Template encoding of each Palaidia Urtite-Cloister race directly correl",
