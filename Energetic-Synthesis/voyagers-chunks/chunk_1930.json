  "text": "Appendix III Ascension Cycle Dynamics Earth is approaching a time continuum shift between 5/5/2000-2017. This continuum shift represents a literal planetary time acceleration. Time accelerations constitute an increase in particle pulsation rhythm for the three-dimensional particle base of Earth. The human body exists as an intrin- sic part of the particle content of Earth. As Earth's particle base accelerates in pulsation rhythm, the particles that compose the human auric field will also increase in pulsation rhythm. If the physical body and bio-neurological struc- ture of the body are not prepared to synthesize the faster pulsating particles of the auric field, this time acceleration will manifest as acceleration of the cel- lular deterioration process. For the body to retain its vitality through the Earth\u2019s time acceleration, the particle pulsation rhythm of the body\u2019s three-dimensional particle base must also increase. The Morphogenetic Seed Crystal Seals within the bio- energetic system of the human body keep the body's particle base locked into the pulsation rhythms of dimensions 1-3. In order to accelerate the pulsation rhythm of the body\u2019s particles, the Seed Crystal Seals must be released, to unlock the body\u2019s particles from the pulsation rhythms of dimensions l-3. Seed Crystal Seals are opened by activation of the body\u2019s Morphogenetic Star Crystal Seals. Star Crystal S",
