  "text": "id fetus is hardy, the human body of its host far more fragile, so the continuation of a pregnancy involving the hybrid would end the life of its mother. Great care is taken during soul agreement abductions to protect both fetus and host. The duration of these pregnancies is a clue to the degree to which the Silicate Matrix has been found present within the mother's genetic code. The longer pregnancies imply a greater presence of this trace gene and thus a greater ability on the part of the mother to engage in interdimensional transmutation. Mothers involved in the longer gestations are those often taken later to visit with their hybrid offspring. Having the Silicate Matrix present within their genetic structures allows for the mothers to undergo the dimensional transmigration necessary for such visitations to take place. As infants or children none of the whites can be brought into the third dimension for any period of time without suffering potentially irreversible damage to their biological structures. For this reason visitations are arranged \u201cbetween dimensions\u201d or within certain contrived \u201cfrequency modulation zones,\u201d whereas the human mother and hybrid child can meet within a temporarily neutral atmosphere. Though visitation with the human mother is usually in the best interest of the child's development, the meetings are arranged only when to do so would also benefit rat",
