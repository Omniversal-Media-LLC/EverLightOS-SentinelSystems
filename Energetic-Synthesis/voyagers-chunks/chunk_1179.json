The infusions of D-5 through D-9 energy will enter the grid of Bridge Zone Earth, and the spontaneous assembly of the fifth DNA strand imprint will begin within the populations whose accretion level at 2012 placed them in the pulsation rhythms of the Bridge Zone time track. The two Earth\u2019s will co- exist simultaneously within the D-4 time cycle between 2012 and 2017 and each of the two groups of people will simultaneously perceive two different sets of events. In order to comprehend the nature of these changes, one must realize that the energy dynamics taking place involve Earth\u2019s particle base being sepa- rated into two different rhythms of particle pulsation, and the particle sub- stance out of which human bodies and consciousness are composed will also experience such a separation. In 2017 human populations will completely separate into two groups, each perceiving a different set of events. These events will take place in two separate fields of particle pulsation rhythm. It will be as if part of the popula- tion \u201cswitched the channel on the television set of manifest events,\u201d one group remains watching the old channel, and the other group switches the channel of perception to a new station. The particle pulsation rhythm of the entire E",
