Return your attention to the Hierophant still positioned 12\" below your feet. 18. Inhale, using the inhale breath to draw the Hierophant up through your Central Vertical Body Current, then out the top of your head (the 7th \u201cCrown\u201d Chakra), to a point about 36\" above the head (the 14th Chakra). _______________________ 2. This is your Maharic seal, a temporary scalar-wave pillar of dimension 10/11/12 frequency light that blocks out disharmonic frequencies from dimensions 1 through 12 and begins to realign disharmonic frequencies in your body and bio-field to their original perfect natural order. 500",
