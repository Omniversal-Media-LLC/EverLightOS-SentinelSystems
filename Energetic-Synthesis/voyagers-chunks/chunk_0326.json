In exchange for the assistance granted by the Breneau these two cultures agreed to allow the Breneau to intervene in the 12-tribes experiment if they did not approve of the developments that took place. The Breneau are concerned with the successful evolution of all life throughout the entire Time Matrix and interdimensional systems. They granted their assistance under the agreement that the Sirian and Pleiadian cultures would step in on their behalf and allow the experiment to be redirected should it at any time pose a threat to the intergalactic/interdimensional structures. These cultures agreed to play this role allowing the Breneau to work as overseers of the project. About 20 million years ago the new strain of Turaneusiam was entered into Earth and began to develop and again digress, and the Breneau petitioned the Sirian councils for intervention in the project. They did not desire to see a repetition of the previous Taran- Turaneusiam experiment, which caused the digression of Tara\u2019s planetary structure. At first the Breneau wanted the experiment to be ended, the species destroyed and the sub-prototypes put out of operation. But the Sirians, on behalf of the Taran Turaneusiam from the first experiment, who had evolved well in other systems, requested that instead of ending the strain the Breneau assist them on",
