The faster moving particle fields of dimensions 9-15 hold the morphogenetic design of a form as it exists in terms of pure, electro-tonal conscious energy. Morphoge- netic dimensions 9-15 are connected to dimensions 1-7 through the D-8 Meta-Galactic Core and energy continually circulates through this 15- dimensional structure. The collective Uni fied Field of the 15-dimensional Universal system is referred to as the 15-Dimensional Matrix. Both planets and people are organ- ically connected to each of the 15 dimensions within the 15-dimensional Matrix. The 15-Dimensional Matrix is structured into five groups of three dimensions called Harmonic Universes and portions of the personal and planetary morphogenetic fields are contained within each of the five Har- monic Universes. Earth represents the HU-1 portion of the planet, Tara rep- resents the HU-2 version of Earth and Gaia represents the HU-3 version of Earth. In terms of humans, the incarnates of Earth are the HU-1 expressions of the personal morphogenetic field, the Soul Matrix or Dora (dimensions 4, 5 and 6) is the HU-2 version of the personal identity and the Over-Soul Matrix or Teura (dimensions 7, 8, and 9) is the HU-3 version of that iden- tity.
