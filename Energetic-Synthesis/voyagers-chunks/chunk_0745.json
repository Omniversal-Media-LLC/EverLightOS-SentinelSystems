  "text": "of Root Race 5 in repairing genetic damage at the end of the Second Seeding, then during the Third Seeding the Templar-Melchizedeks once again intervened, creating a mixed-Cloister race carrying the genetic codes of both lines, which accelerated the evolutionary potentials of the Hibiru and Ayrian/Aryan races. This mix-cloister breeding would later become a major problem for the descendants of this lineage, due to events that transpired 10,000 years ago during the Third Seeding. The mix-cloister Hibiru/Melchizedek race became known as the Hebrew race during the Second and Third Seedings. The Essenes, Templar-Melchizedeks, Hebrew and Christian lineages of the Third Seeding, including those of present day Earth, all carry this genetic advancement. And following the events of 8,000 BC (10,000 YA) those affiliated with the Templar- Melchizedeks would also carry forth a great genetic burden. The spiritual in\ufb02uence of the Templar-Melchizedeks has touched all of the major Christian and Jewish persuasions, and they played an instrumental role in the formation of the modern day Mormon-Christian faith. The Melchizedeks are a primary force within the present times on Earth, as they are now within the third wave of their race birthing cycle. The Melchizedeks hold within their lineage the promise of ascension, even more so than do the fifth Ayrian/Aryan and Hibiru races. But not all Melchi",
