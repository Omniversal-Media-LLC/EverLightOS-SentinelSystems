  "text": "Return to Amenti Ur. By 1309 BC the Elohim plans for opening the Halls of Amenti and pre- paring the races for the mass ascension wave of 2017 AD were lost beneath the chaos left in the wake of Akhenaton\u2019s clandestine rule. Although Akhenaton was ultimately successful in re-entering the Annu people into the Sphere of Amenti and successfully orchestrating the ascension of many individuals during his brief reign, he left an equally detracting legacy of chaos behind him. The Halls of Amenti were closed, the Sphere of Amenti was broken in two, with part of the race morphogenetic field in chaotic sham- bles within the D-2 Earth core and the other part again quarantined in the UHF bands of the third dimension. The Arc of the Covenant was once again sealed, and the Frequency Fence, which kept the Sphere of Amenti from descending through the Arc, was once again put in place. Following the death of Tutankhamon in 1331 BC, the Elohim and the Priests of Ur, disheartened by the error of the human element, transferred surface guardianship of the Arc of the Covenant out of Egyptian hands. The Arc of the Covenant was placed under the protection of the Hibiru Cloister races, under the supervision of the Blue Flame Melchizedeks. The Rod and Staff were de-activated, and thus entry into the portals of the Inner Earth was stripped away from all races within the surface cultures.\u00b9 THE THREE CHRISTS",
