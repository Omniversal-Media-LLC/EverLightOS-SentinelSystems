Once the focus of attention has moved beyond those thoughts and on to the next, the thought imprints left behind become morphogenetic fields, as the now-moment focus of attention moves forward into the next set of fre- quency bands. The process of moving forward through time is the process of progressively accreting sound frequencies into your personal morphogenetic field. As you pass your consciousness through a now-moment point, it internalizes all con- tained within that manifest moment as a minute, digital electro-program made of frequency. The process of internalizing that moment in time expands your morphogenetic field, which creates a subtle acceleration in the pulsation rhythm of the particles of which your body and consciousness are composed. This acceleration of pulsation rhythm perceptually and energetically moves you-as-consciousness forward into the next set of frequency bands. The fre- quency bands of the previous moment internalize and fall from your view, as the set of frequency bands directly above them become your next now-moment of conscious focus. Movement through time is frequency accretion. The manifest illusion you perceive before your eyes is, in reality, a Unified Field of frequency, composed of energy particle substance in the form of digital, electro-tonal tho",
