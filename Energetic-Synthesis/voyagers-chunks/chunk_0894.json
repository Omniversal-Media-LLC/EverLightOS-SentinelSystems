These creed distortions became apparent in the evolution of the surface cultures, as did the progression of the Templar Seal genetic distortion, as well as various other genetic anomalies that were created through inter- breeding with a variety of Interstellar Visitors during the times of Atlantis .\u00b9 The genetic distortions were of great concern to the Palaidorians and guardian races, as if the deviations in the DNA imprint became too numer- ous, the original imprint for the races would be lost. If enough soul essences from lineage with deviating genetic imprints passed back into their race mor- phogenetic field at death, those deviations would eventually override the original patterns in the morphogenetic field. If the Amenti race morphoge- netic field became misaligned with the 12-strand pattern, evolution of the 12-strand DNA package could not take place. In order to preserve the integrity of the Turaneusiam-2/human genetic line , the Sirian Council and Elohim were authorized by the Ra Confederacy to remove certain portions of the race morphogenetic field from the Sphere of Amenti, so the Amenti race morphogenetic field would not become misaligned by deviations in the geneti",
