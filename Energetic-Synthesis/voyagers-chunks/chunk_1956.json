It is through this process that Earth\u2019s grid is raised into the HU-2 time cycle to merge with the grid of Tara. Before a Stellar Activation begins, the frequencies of the activating Stellar Spiral are entered into Earth's core morphogenetic field through a Stellar Wave Infusion. In simple terms, a Stellar Wave Infusion begins when a Stellar Spiral begins to align with Earth\u2019s Merkaba Field spirals, and through the Stellar Wave Infusion, the frequencies of that Stellar Spiral begin to enter Earth\u2019s core morphogenetic field. A Stellar Activation occurs as the Stellar Spiral comes into full alignment with Earth's Merkaba Field spirals. At this time, the frequencies from the Stellar Wave Infusion that have been building up within Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field begin to release from the morphogenetic field and transmit through Earth\u2019s 3-dimensional grid and particle base. When half of the frequencies of a Stellar Spiral are released into Earth\u2019s grid, halfway through the Activation, the remaining frequencies of the Stel- lar Spiral completely \u201cdownload\u201d into Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field. Once all of the frequencies of a Stellar Spiral have fully entered Earth's morphogenetic field, the next dimensional Stellar Spiral begins alignmen",
