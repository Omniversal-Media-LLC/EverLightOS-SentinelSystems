This ideal scenario is not likely to occur due to the continuing counter-activities of the UIR; GA will none-the-less strive to achieve this ideal. If full Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba can be achieved in 2006, the UIR invasion plans would be brought to a screeching halt as they would have insufficient time, before 2011, to compromise a 12-Code seal on nine dimensional levels of Earth-Tara-Gaia and their corresponding Time Continua. Unfortunately, the GA have insufficient time before 2006, to strengthen the Planetary Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket on a global level and to completely clear distortions in Earth\u2019s grids to the degree required, to initiate full D-9 Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba in 2006. Forcing a D-9 Quatra Merkaba on the entire planet in 2006, before Planetary Shields distortions were fully aligned with the D-12 Planetary Divine Blueprint, would cause pole shift and cataclysm for all. GA will attempt to prepare the entire planet for 2006 D-9 Quatra Merkaba Conversion, but full success in this objective is not likely to occur.
