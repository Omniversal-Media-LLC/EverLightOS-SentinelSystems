Perceptual Stations 1. Group One \u2014 Descending Planet Perceptual Station Humans with lower accretion levels will perceive none of the multidi- mensional activity that is taking place. As long as the Frequency Fence is not operational, they will not experience massive Earth changes, but some localized shifting may occur. They will experience a three-day period of ten- sion, fatigue and accelerated atmospheric pressure and a temporary disruption of the function of electrical apparatus at the height of the separation from Earth\u2019s higher vibrating grid in 2017. Scientists may detect odd variations in Earth\u2019s magnetic fields and a sudden, unexplainable increase in gamma ray activity. Solar storms and \ufb02are activity will appear to increase for several months, then rapidly return to normal appearance. At the height of the sepa- ration, a phenomenon that resembles a prolonged, spontaneous solar eclipse may occur, depending upon the stability of Earth\u2019s bio-energetic grid. The most notable occurrence will be that numerous groups of people will seem to have vanished from the Earth without a trace. There will be no explanation for these vanishings in conventional terms. For Earth in the D-3 continuum, little will have appeared",
