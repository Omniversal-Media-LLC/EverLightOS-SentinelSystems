  "text": "y, bio-energetic field and consciousness pulsate at the rate of fifth-dimensional frequency will experientially perceive either direct, bodily transmutation through a time portal passage from Earth to Tara, or a time travel transport to Tara via interdimensional spacecraft (arranged by guardian groups to assist those who cannot quite make it through the dimensional transmutation of the portals). They will end up on Tara in a space-time coordinate about 5,532.5 years in the future from Earth\u2019s original space-time position. At the end of the five-year period following the crest of the morphogenetic wave, people who have not fully assembled the fifth DNA strand will find that the assembled portions of that strand begin to disassem- ble. When Earth returns to its time cycle in the particle universe, the ener- getic imprint of the fifth DNA strand will remain in their bio-energetic field, and will manifest within their anti-particle double on parallel Earth, but the fifth strand will no longer manifest into the person\u2019s operational gene code. The Halls of Amenti will no longer be passable for such individuals until the fifth strand slowly assembles over the course of the next several incarnational cycles within HU-1. These individuals will be stuck in the HU-1 incarna- tional cycles until they can build the fifth strand or until the next morphoge- netic wave period 2213 years later,",
