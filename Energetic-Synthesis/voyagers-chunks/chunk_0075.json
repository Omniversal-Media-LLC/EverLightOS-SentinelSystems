  "text": "the end of the story, it is only the beginning. This book provides the background setting through which the saga of continued human evolution unfolds. I personally believe that events on Earth are occurring as the GA has indicated. The GA and other pro-human Visitor groups are here to help us understand and successfully maneuver the challenges our planet will face during the next 18 years and they hope to lead us gently to a realization of our multi-dimensional heritage. They are also here to teach us to protect ourselves today from Intruder Visitor races that do not have our best interests at heart. It is often said that realization is always personal. One day our race will collectively realize the truth of our rich multi-dimensional heritage. Until that time realization of this reality is right and the responsibility of the individual. I am privileged to introduce the message of the Guardian Alliance. \u2014Anna Hayes, January 1, 1999 now publishing as Ashayana Deane",
