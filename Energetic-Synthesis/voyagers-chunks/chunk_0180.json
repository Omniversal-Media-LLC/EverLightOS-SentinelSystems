If you do not understand the mechanics of the process then it will be difficult for you to decipher the source from which the phenomena emerge. Just as is the case with UFO sightings, \u201cwhat it is\u201d cannot be discovered using only one explanation. UFOs can be a variety of things. So too can be what appears to you as multidimensional communication. Not all UFO sightings imply live contact with other life forms, though some are indeed precisely such contacts. In the event of multidimensional communications, again, not all such communications imply live contact with other-dimensional or inter-time beings, but some of these communications are indeed genuine contact with beings from systems other than your own. Learning to differentiate between the various possible explanations is necessary before an accurate assessment of the phenomena can be achieved in studying both UFOs and multidimensional communication. Some instances of subtle communications (we will use this term henceforth to replace the rather lengthy phrase of \u201cmultidimensional communication\u201d) can be attributed to conditions existing within the mind of the receiver, and others are indeed intended \u201cfakes.\u201d Still other such events are quite legitimate occurrences of subtle communications with a \u201clive\u201d source, be it interdimensional, inter-time, intergalactic or origina",
