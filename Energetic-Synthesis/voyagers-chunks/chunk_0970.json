If the Earth vibration is too low, due to imbalances in its bio-energetic systems, souls carrying higher frequency energies cannot birth onto the planet, for the frequencies con- tained within their bio-energetic fields would literally overload the Earth\u2019s grid and cause it to collapse. The evolution of DNA within the races is dependent upon the vibrational evolution of the Earth. If the condition of the Earth\u2019s bio- energetic field is poor, due to pollution and abuse of its natural environment and digression of the consciousness upon the planet, Earth cannot sustain a concentration of high-frequency soul essence. This also means that Earth cannot hold the UHF of the Sphere of Amenti at its core. If the Sphere of 109",
