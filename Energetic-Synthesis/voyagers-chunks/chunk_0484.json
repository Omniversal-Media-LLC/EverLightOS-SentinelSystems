The individual mind exists and takes place within the dimensionalized construction of the Cosmic Mind. In simple terms the individual mind is composed of consciousness that manifests as electromagnetic micro-particles that travel in dimensionalized bands of frequency and which create the contours of manifest form and identity. The bands of frequency that form the mind structure are composed of Partiki units that group to form \u201cinterwoven fibers or strings of Partiki\u201d called Partiki Grids. Partiki Grids further group to form Keylons, the crystalline structures that form the blueprints for identity and matter manifestation. The Keylon blueprint is the Morphogenetic Field (form-holding template) upon which the structures of the mind and body are built. Within the greater construction of a 15- dimensional Universal Matrix the personal identity possess a 15- dimensional Morphogenetic Field (a \u201cKeylon Body\u201d) that energetically connects the individual identity to the universe and to the cosmos. In universal structure the 15 dimensions are grouped into triads of 3 dimensions each, forming 5 interwoven, over-laid reality fields that are called Harmonic Universes (HU). Each individual mind has a level of",
