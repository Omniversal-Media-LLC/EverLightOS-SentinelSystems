  "text": "Ascension Cycle Dynamics You must know: A. What Stellar Spirals carry what frequencies and when the Spiral aligns with Earth, making those frequencies available. B. Where your higher and lower chakras and Star Crystal Seals are located, what frequencies each chakra can draw in and how the chakras correspond to the Star Crystal Seals you need to activate. The in-body chakras of 1-7 correspond to the frequency bands of dimen- sions 1-7. The higher-dimensional chakras that correspond to dimensions 9- 15 are called Morphogenetic Chakras, as they open into and draw energy from the morphogenetic fields of dimensions 1-7, which are correspondingly located in dimensions 9-14. The lower dimensions and chakras are linked to the higher dimensions and morphogenetic chakras through the Meta-galactic Core at D-8 and the eighth chakra; the activated eighth chakra allows you to draw frequency from the morphogenetic chakras down into the lower chakra centers. To activate certain Star Crystal Seals you will open the morphogenetic chakra that corresponds to the lower chakras with which that Seal is associ- ated, then draw frequency from the morphogenetic chakra into the Star Crystal Seal. It is not difficult to do once you understand the correspondences between the lower chakras, their Star Crystal Seals and the morphogenetic chakras. For your convenience we provide the following charts. ASCENSIO",
