But the populations in these regions will still have some time left to develop biological co-resonance with Safe Zones, after Particle Conversion occurs. The 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble will create sta- ble areas of land mass and culture that are held secure within D-9 Quatra Phase Merk- aba Field protection, and which will sustain a constant D-4.25 magnetic field. The D- 4.25 magnetic field will allow any life forms with 4.25 DNA Strand Template activa- tion\u00b2 to move into Safe Zone territories for final 2012 transition into the Inner Earth Bridge Zone Time Continuum. Originally a 4.5 DNA Strand Template activation level was needed for passage into the Bridge Zone continuum. Now, populations with a lower 4.25-DNA Strand Template activation will have greater opportunity to \u201cmake it to the Bridge Zone\u201d in 2012. The general Trion/ Meajhe Field Buffer Blanket in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere will provide non-Safe Zone regions with some degree of protection during the 3-Day Particle Conversion period, preventing full planetary magnetic field collapse. These areas will be less stable and more prone to anomalous geological, climatic, atmospheric and electromagnetic phenomena than Safe Zone areas under the 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble protection. Fol- lowing the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, and until 2012, regions and populations c",
