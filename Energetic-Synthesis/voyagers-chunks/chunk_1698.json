The Azurite LPIN was known as the ''Faces of Man,'' ancient depictions of which can still be found in the ''heads'' rock sculptures of Easter Island off the coast of Peru, which were erected by Mu\u2019a race descendants after their exile from Kauai, Hawaii. 3 There are ''12 Heads'' in the Faces of Man LPIN system\u2014one set of four Heads on Earth, another set of four Heads on Parallel Earth and the final set of four Heads on Inner Earth. Collectively, the 12 Faces of Man are known as the ''Guardians of the 12 Pillars.'' Each set of four Lumerian Pylon Implant \u201cFaces\u201d grids connects directly to the other two corresponding sets of \u201cfour Faces\u201d on Parallel and Inner Earth. When the Faces of Man LPIN is activated, four massive pillars of inaudible, interdimensional standing sound waves anchor in Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields through the \u201cfour Faces\u201d template. The four Sound Pillars in each planetary body carry the full frequency spectra of dimensions 3-6-9-12, a frequency combination known as the ''Halls of Amorea Passage.'' The Halls of Amorea Passage frequency bridge connects Earth, its Parallel and Inner Earth directly to the Universal Pre-matter Template \u201cDivine Blueprint\u201d of Aramatena-Lyra (\u201cDouble-Double\u201d), via D-6 Sirius B Star Gate-6, D-9 Star Gate-9 Mirach Andromeda and the Trans-Harmonic Time Cycle.
