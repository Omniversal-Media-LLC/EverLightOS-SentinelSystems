If this endeavor were to be successful, and the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes were to be reactivated as the Meajh\u00e9 Zones of Earth were transitioning into the Bridge Zone con- tinuum, cataclysm would result. The Quatra Phase Merkaba needed for the Bridge Zone link would be slowed in speed, via \u201cTrumpet\u201d pulse, to that of a D-6 Hallah Phase Mer- kaba Vehicle. Once Meajh\u00e9 Fields were reduced to D-6 vibration, the \u201cTrumpet Pulses\u201d of D-7 Phantom Arcturus could be used to force Earth\u2019s D-6 Hallah Phase Merkaba into the reverse-rotation characteristic to Phantom Matrix. The Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blan- ket would prevent Meajh\u00e9 areas of Earth from being pulled into Phantom Matrix, but would not sustain grid speed acceleration sufficient to make the Bridge Zone link. Cata- clysmic Earth changes would begin followed by pole shift by 2012. If this diabolical UIR strategy were to succeed, little of Earth\u2019s populations would survive. GA Maharajhi fleets from Sirius B would descend through the Halls of Amorea passage in attempt to launch 552",
