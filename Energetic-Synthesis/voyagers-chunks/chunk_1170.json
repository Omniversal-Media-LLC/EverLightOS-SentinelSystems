When information about the possible validity of ET presence begins to make it into public view, the Dracos-Zeta Resistance will present themselves as Guardians and attempt to make guardian groups appear as intruders. The Resistance may orchestrate a mass landing in 2001, but only if they are confi- dent that they will succeed in motivating human Interior Government to conduct the 2003 experiment. If by 2001, the Resistance fears their Fre- quency Fence plan will not succeed, they will not stage a landing. They will still work to instigate the 2003 experiment, and may increase their abduc- tions within the general populace, making it appear as though guardian groups are responsible, in order to trick the Interior Government to continue with the 2003 experiment. The shift in the perspective of the propaganda program will take place between 2001-2003, if it takes place at all. If news validating the reality of visiting ET presence reaches public dis- tribution networks by 2001 you can be sure the Dracos-Zeta Frequency Fence plan is still in operation and that the Interior Government continues to work with the Resistance. If a mass level, public landing takes place any time between 2001\u20142003, realize these are not friendly Visitors regardless of what they may claim.",
