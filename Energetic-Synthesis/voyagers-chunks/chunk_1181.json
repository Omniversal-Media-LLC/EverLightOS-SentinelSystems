  "text": "Time Shift In the Bridge Zone particle base, the angular rotation of particle spin will be altered by the Guardians, in order for it to be transferred into the pulsation rhythms of the Bridge Zone-Agartha time continuum in 2017. The angular rotation of particle spin of Earth\u2019s higher vibrating particle base will be shifted 22.5\u00b0 in reverse from the angle of particle rotation of Earth's lower vibrating particle base. This separation of particle pulsation rhythms will reach completion in 2017, just when Earth\u2019s grid is in full alignment with that of Tara and the Holographic Beam passes through the Photon Belt into direct alignment with Earth\u2019s seventh vortex/chakra. As the energies of the Holographic Beam pass into the Earth\u2019s bio-energetic field in 2017, the higher and lower vibrating particle bases of Earth will completely separate. The lower vibrating particle base will rapidly drop in vibration and return to the pulsation rhythm of the D-3 time continuum. The higher vibrating par- ticle base will complete its 22.5\u00b0 reverse shift in angular rotation of particle spin and fix its pulsation rhythm at the 3.5-accretion level of the Bridge Zone-Agartha time continuum. When this separation transition completes in 2017, the populations will find themselves permanently divided into two separate groups. Perceptual Stations 1.
