Most will simply have their bio- energetic fields adjusted to facilitate rapid fifth DNA strand building. (Note: clones created by the Guardian ET groups are expressly for the purpose of facil- itating human ascensions. These are not to be confused with cloning tactics used by intruder Dracos-Zeta forces for in filtration into human culture). V oy- agers on the Transports will be taken into outer space, then through the D-4 Merkaba Field at the center of the Sun and into the Halls of Amenti at the D- 4 level (this is the same ascension path used by souls who die/drop their bodies and ascend to Tara as soul essence. However, individuals on the Transports will not be leaving a body behind). The Transport craft will emerge through the core of Tara\u2019s Sun in D-5, then proceed to landing facilities on Tara. Interdi- mensional Transport vessels are designed for such solar passage, as they are able to modulate frequency bands and alter the composition of their structure. Most human V oyagers will experience a period of deep sleep then a bit of temporary time disorientation as the Transports encounter the solar passages. Once they land on Tara, the Transport V oyagers will experience the same orientation events as those who ascended directly through",
