Though Earth still fuses with Tara and releases a morphogenetic wave as intended, just as that wave begins to crest (2012), the Earth changes begin. When the morphogenetic wave begins to crest, the Halls of Amenti portals open, but the Earth grid must be stable in order for the Halls to remain open through their 10-year cycle (2012-2022). The Earth changes cause a premature closing of the Halls of Amenti, which creates a rapid drop in Earth\u2019s grid speed. The Sphere of Amenti cannot be left in Earth's core during this drop in vibration or the Earth grid will explode. In this future probability, Guardians remove the Sphere of Amenti from Earth and human populations come under direct covert control of the Dracos-Zeta Resis- tance. The Zeta Seal genetic mutation is returned to the human race. Once Earth is under Dracos-Zeta rule, the Zetas are attacked and dominated by the Dracos group with whom they had been working. The Dracos take command of Earth in both the D-3 and D-4 time cycles and begin to use the D-3 Earth as a storehouse for unwanted photo-nuclear waste materials from the D-4 Tara-Earth time cycle. (Photo-nuclear waste is produced through certain pro- cesses involving the manufacture of photonic energy through manipulation of multidimensional nucl",
