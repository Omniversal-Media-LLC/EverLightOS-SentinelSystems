Their bodies are able to endure some degree of transmutation, even if it is only the small amount of acceleration in body vibrational rates needed to accommodate the hybrid fetus. Like the donors, these women usually experience abductions that take place within the third-dimensional field, in which holographic inserts, perceptual interference and \u201ccover memories\u201d are utilized to distort or block memory of the event. However, because of the trace of the Silicate Matrix within their gene code they are able to sustain the beginnings of pregnancy involving a hybrid fetus. The hybrid fetus develops in its early weeks and months in the same way as the human fetus would mature. It carries a slightly higher cellular oscillation rate than that of a human, but this difference is so minute that the fetus would appear to you as no different than that of a human. As the fetus develops certain vibrational patterns within the genetic base code begin to change, making the fetal pattern more and more incompatible with the body resonance of its host. At some point the fetus must be removed and transferred to another dimensional frequency where its development can progress. Mothers who have carried such pregnancies, only to find their fetuses missing, have",
