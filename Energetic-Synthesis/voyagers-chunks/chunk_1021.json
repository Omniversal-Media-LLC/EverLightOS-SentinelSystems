The D- 5 Merkaba Field serves to hold Tara-Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field and particle base in place. Tara-Earth\u2019s D-6 Merkaba field extends thousands of miles out from Tara- Earth into outer space in HU-2, at the sixth-dimensional frequency level. It serves to keep Tara\u2019s atmosphere in place and encompasses within its energy field HU-2 planet Tara, the planets of Tara\u2019s solar system, the planets orbiting around Alcyone in the Pleiades in HU-1 and all of the planets orbiting around Earth\u2019s Sun in HU-1. The multidimensional structures of planetary Merkaba Fields are referred to as Stellar Spirals. They represent vast con- structs of electromagnetic energy through which all planetary systems in the 15-dimensional galaxy are energetically connected. The Merkaba Fields of the higher dimensions encompass the Merkaba Fields of the lower dimensions and all matter forms contained within them. The frequencies of the 15 smaller-dimensional Merkaba Fields combine to form larger Harmonic Universe Merkaba Fields. Harmonic Universe Merk- aba Fields combine to form the largest Merkaba Field, the Meta-galactic Merkaba Field. The Meta-galactic Merkaba Field is composed of a 15- dimensional, inverted, counterclockwise spiraling magnetic field and an upright, 15-dimensional c",
