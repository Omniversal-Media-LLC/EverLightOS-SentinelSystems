You may not have to imagine the sensation of energy rushing through you at all, for this is the energetic reality of what is taking place. The degree to which you can sense this energy release will depend upon how sensitized your neurological structure is to higher fre- quency energy. This sensitivity will increase the more you engage your consciousness in activities such as this exercise. Exercises like this activate dormant DNA codes, which program the body to build new neuro-pas- sageways and nerve endings. This increases the body\u2019s ability to sense sub- tle energy and expands the perceptual range of consciousness while it is focused in the body. \u2022 As you visualize photonic light running through your body, consciously guide that light directly into the DNA, while holding the intention that the body will use this energy to accelerate the DNA-building process, under the direction of 495",
