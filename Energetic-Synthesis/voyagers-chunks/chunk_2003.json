The dark areas represent parts of the body in which slower-pulsating particles are stored, the dark areas are the karmic imprints you seek to release. \u2022 Next, move your attention into one of the dark areas as fully as possible, feel its sensations and become aware of the pulsation rhythm of the energy in that inter- nal space. It will have a distinct feel of rhythm that you can detect if you move your attention into it. \u2022 Become aware of the difference between the pulsation rate of your con- sciousness and that of the dark area, then consciously slow the pulsation rate of your consciousness to match that of the dark area. Feel yourself moving down into the blackness of the dark space, slowing the rhythm of your consciousness, spreading out, and becoming one with the area.
