  "text": "ion is not channeling, it is the remote transfer of electronically encoded data. Channeling involves merging the personal consciousness with other portions of personal identity, the energy identities of beings from other times, places or dimensions or the direct absorption of electrically encoded data from the crystalline universal memory matrix. In Keylontic Communication the personal consciousness remains within its usual conscious focus as a communicator from elsewhere intentionally transmits electronically encoded data to the receiver via remote projection of frequency.) The GA organized their message in the form of a book that was completed between late 12/1996 and late 2/1997. On 10/25/1997 the GA orchestrated a physical consensual abduction through which new information on the Bridge Zone Project was provided. On 6/26/1998, due to events that are explained in the Volume II, the GA added nearly 200 pages of new information to their original message. The first two volumes of the Voyagers series, The Sleeping Abductees and Secrets of Amenti, are the compilation of the 12/1996 and 6/1998 GA Keylontic transmissions. It represents the first official GA message to the people of contemporary Earth. It is their message, presented in their format, using their words. I do not claim authorship for this book, as I served only as translator of information that originates with the GA.",
