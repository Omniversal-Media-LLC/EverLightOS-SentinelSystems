When at least 8% of Earth\u2019s populations carried the corrected imprint, the Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field would realign and the morphogenetic field of Tara-Earth in the future would follow suit and begin realigning. Through this astral involvement with humans, the Guardians were able to begin dismantling the Frequency Fence on Earth and on Tara-Earth. In 1986, Earth populations carrying the re-aligned fourth DNA imprint peaked at 8%, and the Zetas\u2019 Frequency Fence on Earth deteriorated. The Tara-Earth Frequency Fence of the future also began to unravel, and the Zetas began losing control over their future human populations. The Zetas began interacting directly with Earth\u2019s present cultures in 1926, in order to survey the effects of Guardian intervention on their Fre- quency Fence, and to monitor the progression of the fourth-strand mutation within the human DNA. They were aware of the upcoming half-point ascension cycle and that their Frequency Fence would be collapsing at some point before 20l2. The Zetas knew that they would have to reconstruct the Frequency Fence and take action to prevent Earth\u2019s grid from receiving its scheduled infusion of D-5 through D-9 frequency. They decided they would create Zeta-human hybrids, which possessed mutated fourth-strand genetic codes, to repopulate the Earth following 2017. After the hybrids were cre- ated, and their Frequency",
