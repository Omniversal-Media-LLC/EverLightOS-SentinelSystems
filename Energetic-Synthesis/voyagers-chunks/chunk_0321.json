Even those who did not go would not believe that anything bad had happened. The masses simply \u201cwent with Christ to the promised lands,\u201d as had been foretold. This is what a holographic insert can do! And some of the Zeta, the unenlightened ones following the old agenda, are quite capable of this type of travesty. Not only are they capable of this, this is precisely the type of holographic drama they have planned once the \u201cfrequency fence\u201d is in place. If you find security in the concept of being \u201csheep,\u201d then please, make sure you know who your shepherd is!",
