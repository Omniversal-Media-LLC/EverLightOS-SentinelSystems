This Symbol Code will assist the Reasoning Mind of your Dream self and the Reasoning Mind of your waking focus that you are bringing into the dream, to merge successfully in the dream state. It will further direct the unified Reasoning Mind into the Supraconscious Mind of the Soul Matrix. As you relax with the image of the white pin-point of light \u201cMonitor\u201d within the blue circle Symbol Code, call to mind the target you have previously \u201classoed.\u201d Imagine the contents of the lasso, the target you have previously placed within its boundaries and try to sense the energy signature of the contents. There will be a \u201cfeel\u201d to the contents of the lasso, which represents the Keylon Code morphogenetic energy identity of the thoughts, images, emotions and sensations contained within the lasso. Next, color the \u201cLasso\u201d Symbol Code yellow gold. This will program the subliminal suggestion that the intellectual/Reasoning Mind will be operable within the dream and will serve to organize the dream information for retrieval by the waking consciousness. Mentally take the dangling \u201ctail\u201d of the golden lasso and connect it to the Monitor pin-point of white light. Visualize the Monitor pulling the Lasso into its center until all that remains is a tiny golden speck of light at the center of the white pin-point of light. Now give the mental command \u201cMonitor Retrieve.\u201d Continue to visu",
