For the Bridge Zone project to succeed, this acceleration must be intense enough to raise both overtone and base tone particles into HU-2 rhythms, and must also be able to counter balance the ULF EM pulses of the Frequency Fence the Dra- cos-Zetas plan to use in 2004. If Earth does not make it into the pulsation rhythm of the D-4 time cycles by 2012, full merger between the grids of Earth and Tara will not take place, the Halls of Amenti will not open and Earth will not be able to shift into the Bridge Zone Cycle. In this case the Frequency Fence transmissions of the Dra- cos-Zeta Resistance (should they be successful in orchestrating their 2003 experiment) will begin chain reaction Earth changes between 2012-2017, as the natural fusion process of particle and anti-particle within the Earth\u2019s grid are disrupted. The Frequency Fence would cause the particle pulsation rhythms in cer- tain portions of Earth grid to drop rapidly in speed, while other portions of the particle base attempted to rise in speed. The fabric of Earth\u2019s particle base would begin to tear open and fragment. In areas of Earth\u2019s grid where this frag- mentation occurred, landmasses would begin to break apart, new fissures within the Earth\u2019s tectonic plates wou",
