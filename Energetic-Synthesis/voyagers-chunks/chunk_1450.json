Through Universal Star Gate-12, the D-12 ''Christos Templat'' frequencies can be run through the planetary bodies in a galaxy, to reset the original natural Pre-matter Tem- plate, or \u201c Divine Blueprint\u201d, upon which the galaxy and its planets first manifested. The Mu\u2019a races of the Palaidia Empires were designated as 12th Gate Universal Guardians, and so they were settled in geographical loca- tions of Earth that corresponded to Earth\u2019s activation and opening sites of the Universal Star Gate-12 Lyra-Aramatena Gate. The Mu\u2019a race lines were incarnate members of the GA\u2019s D-12 Council of Lyra-Aramatena. The Mu\u2019a races held the Universal Signet Key and Encryption Key Codes to all 12 Universal, Galactic and Planetary Star Gates within their DNA Templates. The Mu\u2019a races were thus settled in locations correspond- ing to Earth\u2019s Star Gate-12, and also in locations corresponding to other Star Gates of Earth\u2019s Templar that were in most need of additional security. The Yu races of the Palaidia Empires carried the Universal Master Key and Encryption Key Codes to Universal, Galactic and Planetary Star Gates 2 through 11 in their 37-42 Strand DNA Templates. Universal Star Gate- 11 is the Density-4, D-11 Pre-matter gate corresponding to Aveyon, Lyra, the second most powerful Star Gate in the Universal Templar. Mem",
