Mastery of multidimensional science requires having knowledge of the minute, electro-tonal units of energy that form all particles and frequency bands within dimensional systems and the dynamics of elec- tro-magnetism created through the interplay of these ultra-micro energy units. Consciousness and matter are both composed of these units of electro- tonal energy and so both spiritual and scienti fic mastery are brought together through the applied knowledge of these electro-tonal energy dynamics. Key- lontic Science provides the foundations of knowledge upon which mastery of matter and consciousness can be achieved. Keylontic Science derives its name from the word Keylon. A Keylon is a composite of ultra-micro electro-tonal energy units called Partiki. Keylons group with other Keylons to form dimensionalized, crystalline structures of energy that exist as the base morphogenetic (form-holding) templates behind and within all matter forms, particles and consciousness. Keylons compose the frequency fields of sound and light upon which the entire Cosmic matrix is structured; the Unified Field of cosmic energy is composed of groups of crystalline Keylons. Keylons also compose the mo",
