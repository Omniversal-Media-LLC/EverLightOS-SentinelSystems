  "text": "Three Tracks of Time THREE TRACKS OF TIME Humanity Facing Three Probable Futures and Three Tracks of Time The technical information we have provided on the mechanics of the Bridge Zone Project serves to illustrate some of the operations of multidimen- sional physics. We are quite aware that it will be centuries before earthly sci- entific communities can comprehend some of the dynamics of which we speak. We provided the information so those of scientific persuasion might begin to realize the sophistication of true spiritual science, so they might be less prone to dismiss the importance of the information we have given. We suggest that one use the intuitive senses when trying to understand some of the more complicated concepts we have presented, as the intuitions are bet- ter equipped to translate this data into cognition, than are the facilities of the logical-analytical mind alone. To simplify the meaning of the Bridge Zone Project, it can be viewed as the vessel through which three probable future paths of development open to the human population. Between the years 2012-20l7, there will be three distinct time continua into which the human consciousness can pass to continue its evolutionary journey. These time con- tinua represent three different tracks of time that different portions of humanity will follow. 1. Time Track One-\u2014Voyagers Ascension\u2014D-4 Time Cycle 5532.5-year Lea",
