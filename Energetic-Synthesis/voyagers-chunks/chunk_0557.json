Some of them are falsely claiming, quite piously, that their legions are the Royal House of \u201cAveyon,\u201d the self-proclaimed \u201coriginators\u201d of the earth human race. The Density-4 Lyra planet Aveyon, which housed Star Gate-11, was indeed the place of origin of the Feline-Aquatic-Ape Anyu Race. The Anyu Race is the hybrid Elohei-Elohim/Bra-ha-Rama race that suffered genetic digression and rebelled against the Founders 250 billion years ago, to become the D-11 Annu-Elohim Fallen Angelic Legion, from which the Anunnaki Fallen Angelic Annu-Elohim avenger races later emerged. The contemporary Anunnaki lines claiming to be the \u201cRoyal House of Aveyon\u201d are in truth the \u201cFallen Royal House of Aveyon.\u201d The Fallen Angelic Anyu Race that became the Fallen Annu-Elohim, intentionally traded in their original genetic capacity to hold the natural minimum 12-Strand DNA Template \u201cChristos Potential,\u201d characteristic to the Christos Founders Races, for a digressive 11-Strand DNA Template mutation.
