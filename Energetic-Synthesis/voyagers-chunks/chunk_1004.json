Since 840,000 years ago, when the guardian races from HU-2 and above created the Arc of the Covenant, they have watched, waited, nurtured, guided, assisted and prayed (yes, prayed!) for the time to come when the lost souls of Tara could return home from their long and troubled evolutionary journey on Earth. They did this because your race was loved. They have waited patiently for the distant time when Earth, and the 11 other missing fragments of Tara, could be returned into Tara\u2019s energetic body, so Tara herself could ascend. Great wars have been fought and great catastrophes endured to secure your species\u2019 right to evolve, and to uphold and protect the Covenant of Palaidor, through which the integrity of your species\u2019 evolutionary blue- print is ensured. Can you understand how important the next morphogenetic wave will be in relation to the evolution of Earth and the souls who continue to repeat- edly incarnate there? The next morphogenetic wave in your present 26,556- year cycle is your potential ticket to freedom, after being imprisoned within the illusion of HU-1 matter for over 200,000 years. If you are unable to utilize that potential, you will sentence yourselves to yet another 26,556 years in the prison of your Earth school, if your planet could survive",
