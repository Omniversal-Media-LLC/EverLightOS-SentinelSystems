As their respective soul essences pass through the Sphere of Amenti, the frequency bands carried in their energetic essence will purge mutations from the human DNA imprint, allowing DNA strands 2-7 to realign with the orig- inal 12-strand DNA pattern of the HU-2 Turaneusiam-human prototype. Without the birth of these avatars mutations within the human DNA code would prevent humans from properly assembling and activating the DNA strands and humanity would be unable to achieve acceleration of evolution and ascension to the Bridge Zone, Tara or beyond. Each avatar is assigned to the realignment of one DNA strand, which will be achieved as the soul essence passes through the Sphere of Amenti during fetal integration.
