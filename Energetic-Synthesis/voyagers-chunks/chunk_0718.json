  "text": "The Secrets of Amenti Seal of Amenti, which appear as a build-up of electrical particles within the etheric body called miasms, which distort the natural functioning of the chakra system and accelerate the manifestation of physical disease. The Seal of Palaidor must be released before the Seal of Amenti can release, both achieved by assembling the full fourth DNA strand. For a period of time following the end of the Electric Wars, Earth could not sustain life. For over 4,000 years Earth was plagued by erratic weather patterns, tectonic shifting and climatic anomalies. Earth experienced a slow, partial pole reversal and tilted several degrees on its axis between 5,508,100 and 5,504,000 years ago, as a result of damage done to Earth's energetic grid and portal systems during the Electric Wars. Numerous ET races visited the planet during its more stable periods, some serving as Guardians over the Sphere of Amenti. Various animal forms were again reseeded by visiting races. Approximately 5,504,000 years ago a sudden, final shift in Earth's grid, as its poles realigned, caused a \u201cquick freeze\u201d Ice Age to occur, which wiped out most life-forms on the planet except for some of those residing in deep caverns beneath the seas. Following this shift the vibrational rate of Earth's grid dropped swiftly and it could no longer hold the higher frequencies of the Sphere of Amenti at its core.",
