The \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d represents the collective re- ality fields of the D-5 frequency bands, (and the D-5 consciousness contained there within), as viewed in condensed form, by consciousness stationed in lower dimensions. One moves closer to the light as the par- ticle pulsation rhythm of the consciousness accelerates to the rhythm of the D-5 frequency bands. The light will appear to take on spherical form, like a blazing sun, as the consciousness nears the D-5 pulsation rhythm. One merges with the light when the consciousness has reached D-5 pul- sation rhythm. This is the process you will encounter after death, but it can be used consciously while you are still in body, for many different pur- poses. When you perceive the light you are seeing the fifth dimension. \u2022 Once visualizing yourself in the light, submerge yourself within it and feel that light move through every cell in your body, imagine it moving through your DNA.
