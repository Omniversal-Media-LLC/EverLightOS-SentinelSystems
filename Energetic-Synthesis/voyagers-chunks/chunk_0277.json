Zeta Conspiracy The Zeta following the old agenda believe themselves to be desperate. They are weakening\u2014their bodies and abilities are failing. Though the majority of Zeta have transferred to the new agenda there are still several hundred thousand following the old plan, both in your dimension and in those surrounding it. Collectively they still represent quite a force, a force that can impact your future adversely if it is allowed to go unchecked. They are presently trying to orchestrate, through the workings of your Interior Government (previously discussed), a travesty upon your species. The humans involved in this scheme are blinded by the pursuit of power and domination. And it is because of their involvement and willing participation that the old agenda still looms as a potential threat to your system. Though much assistance is being offered to your species from the guardian races the events you encounter will still be the consequences of your choices, individually and collectively.",
