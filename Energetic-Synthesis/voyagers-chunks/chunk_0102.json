In November of 1999, the last of the 12 CDT-Plates, once called the \u201cTables of Testimony\u201d by the Knights Templar races, was retrieved by the Azurites from a contemporary Freemason family line through which possession of the CDT-Plate had been passed from Atlantian generations. The 12 Signet Shields still remain buried in various hidden locations on Earth. Since the times of the 208,216 BC cataclysm, the Azurite Races of the Sirius B Council of Azurline have periodically offered dispensations of knowledge translated from the CDT-Plates to the evolving human cultures of Earth. Translations of the CDT-Plates were the first foundations of ALL legitimate spiritual teachings among ALL races of Earth, before the genuine CDT-Plate translations were repeatedly compromised, destroyed and distorted into \u201creligious control dogmas\u201d by competing factions of corrupt human power elite and Fallen Angelic visitors. Each time the Azurites offer return of CDT-Plate translations, three CDT-Plate Speakers incarnate through the Maharaji race line Council of Azurline from Sirius, into the human \u201cIndigo Child\u201d Grail Line on Earth (See \u201cThe IAFW, Azurite Security Team and the MC Eieyani Master Council\u201d on page 162.), to serve as the three CDT-Plate translators or \u201cSpeakers\u201d.",
