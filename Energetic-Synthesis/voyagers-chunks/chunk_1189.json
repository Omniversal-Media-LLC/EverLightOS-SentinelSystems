  "text": "10 Opening the Halls of Amenti CONTEXT If you will recall from our discussions in earlier chapters, from 1972 for- ward the Guardians had quite a few things to accomplish before the Halls of Amenti could open between 2012 \u20142017. The Earth\u2019s grid speed had to be raised high enough by 10/1986 to spark open the first seal on the Arc of the Covenant, so the Sphere of Amenti would descend and be in position within Earth\u2019s core no later than 1/1/1988. Between 1/1/1988 and 6/30/1998 the Sphere of Amenti would transmit its D-1, D-2 and D-3 frequencies into Earth\u2019s grid, so by 6/30/1998 Earth\u2019s grid speed would rise high enough to spark the second seal on the Arc of the Covenant. Earth could then begin ascent into the pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time cycle. If all went well, on 1/1/2000 the Sphere of Amenti would begin transmit- ting D-4 frequency through Earth\u2019s core and the fourth DNA strand imprint would soon become available to the populations who had a fully assembled third strand, into which the fourth strand could be plugged. The Blue Flame of Amenti would begin its 12-year descent to Earth between 1/1/2000 and 5/5/2012. On 5/5/2012 Earth would begin its intersection with Tara\u2019s grid, the Blue Flame would embody within the Keepers of the Blue Flame and the masses who had assembled the fourth DNA strand would rapidly assemble the fifth strand for ascension to Tara.
