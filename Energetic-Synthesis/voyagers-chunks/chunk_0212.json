Often there will be memory of an odd event (\u201cmissing time\u201d, a UFO sighting, or uncharacteristic emotional or behavioral reaction, etc....), surrounding the event which has not yet surfaced into conscious memory. Hypnosis would then serve to assist the mind to translate and integrate more of the new imprint, bringing it to the surface of memory. The event of sequential memory of the abduction returning to the abductee marks the point of integration of the new cellular imprint; the \u201cmind has caught up with the experiences of the body\u201d so to speak. It constitutes the return of the full consciousness (which was fragmented during the event) to the focus within the present time, or the return of consciousness to its original frequency band. To integrate the full imprint of such a multi-time event the human organism literally manufactures new, minute neurotransmitters and nerve networks to accommodate the altered DNA imprint. Your three-dimensional instruments presently cannot record most of these activities as these instruments are \u201ckeyed\u201d or \u201ctuned\u201d to only the three- dimensional time coordinate in your particular frequency. You may eventually be able to chart the \u201cresults\u201d (the portion of this activity that does take place within the three-dimensional frequency) of such base code manipulations, but you will not fi",
