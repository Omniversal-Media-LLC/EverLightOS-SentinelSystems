Through subsequent live encounters (some physical) the GA explained that the dry-data communications were made possible through my childhood training in translation of the universal Keylontic Symbol Code language. The GA was able to pre-record information for me, in the form of digital data packages called Keylontic Symbol Codes. The GA would program the Keylontic Codes into my bio-energetic system via remote electronic transmission. Once the encoded data had been programmed into my bio-energetic field, it would process through my neurological structure in the form of electrical impulse. Through the natural bio- chemical and electrical translation processes inherent to the human biological form, the electronically encoded information would translate into my native language and appear in my mind as direct cognition, formatted into either word text or image pictures. I did not hear the words in my mind, as no audible sound was involved, a stream of worded information would simply flow through my mind and I could feel the words as electrical impulse patterns. Image translation came in the same way, no mental pictures, but rather clearly felt electrical impul",
