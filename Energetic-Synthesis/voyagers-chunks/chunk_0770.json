  "text": "t say that planets and people ascend/evolve through the dimensional scale through the intrinsic universal laws of energy which form and hold together the structures of consciousness that form identities in time. Spiritual ascension is not separate from these laws of energy structure, for conscious- ness is sentient energy, and must therefore abide by the natural energetic laws which hold universal structure in order. Ascension is a science, with speci\ufb01c mechanics that allow for the evolution of consciousness from simple to more com- plex forms. In the highest states of evolution identity evolves into the highest dimensional fields and then beyond, moving from the simple forms of biolog- ical expression into the more complex structures of pure conscious identity. Every being in existence is involved in this evolutionary process, and so the dynam- ics of the science of ascension apply directly to each and every one of you. If you can realize the signi ficance of this science your evolution will occur much 39",
