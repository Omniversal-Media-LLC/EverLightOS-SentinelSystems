Agartha represents an Earth reality field that exists between the Earth and her parallel double. Earth\u2019s D-1 iron core crystal is stationed within the first-dimensional frequency bands of the particle universe, at 0-accretion level. Anti-particle Earth\u2019s D-1 iron core crystal is stationed within the D-2 frequency bands of the particle universe, Earth\u2019s elemental kingdom, at accre- tion level 1. Agartha\u2019s D-1 iron core crystal can be viewed as being stationed halfway between Earth\u2019s D-1 core crystal and the core crystal of parallel Earth at particle universe D-2, which would represent a .5-accretion level in the D- 1 frequency bands. For Earth, parallel Earth and Agartha, the elemental body is one dimensional band above the placement of the iron core crystal, and the mental body/atmosphere is one dimensional band above the elemen- tal body, or two dimensional bands above the iron core crystal: \u2022 The particle base of Earth is in D-1 of the particle universe at accretion level 0 to 1. \u2022 The particle base of parallel Earth is in D-2 of the particle universe at accretion level 1 to 2. \u2022 The particle base of Agartha is half in D-1 and half in D-2 of the particle universe, at an accretion level of .",
