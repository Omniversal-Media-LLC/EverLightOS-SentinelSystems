(You are also doing this when you use certain chemicals, and when you are doing \u201cbody-work therapy\u201d and therapies that involve conscious release of cellular memory). The cells that you stimulate will indeed translate the energy, or electrical impulse you have sent. The \u201calphabet\u201d within the cells will translate that impulse into perceptual data characteristic to the particular electromagnetic codes or Fire Letters you have randomly chosen. In such experiments it is as if you randomly \u201cpull letters from the alphabet,\u201d then throw them on the table and decide that the alphabet is meaningless because you cannot make coherent \u201cwords\u201d out of the \u201cletters\u201d you have chosen. You are ignoring the rest of the alphabet and the multiple levels of translation this alphabet undergoes as it synthesizes the multiple levels of meaning into a cohesive picture of reality. When you stimulate the brain and create \u201cabduction-like\u201d perceptual experiences, might we simply suggest that you are accessing part of a translation of a few of the \u201calphabet letters.\u201d This in no way proves that other abduction cases are not real, it only proves that you can stimulate or recreate a version of that experience through artificial means by activating the innate cellular alphabet of fixed electromagnetic code patterns.
