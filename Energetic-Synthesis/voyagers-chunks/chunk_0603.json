Though peaceful solutions appeared promising, following the 1992 Sirian- Pleiadian Agreements, the September 12th, 2000 declaration of War by the United Resistance confirms that the \u201cFinal Round\u201d of this ancient confrontation will progressively move into the contemporary Earth arena. The outcome of this drama lies squarely in humanity\u2019s hands. Since the failed Star Gate Opening Cycle of 22,326 BC, Guardian Angelic nations have repeatedly attempted to awaken the Angelic Humans of Earth so humanity could create its freedom and prepare for the peaceful but direct intervention that would be required when the the time of the final conflict arrived. Since 22,326 BC, and the later fall of the Atlantian Nations in 9558 BC and subsequent Nibiruian Fallen Angelic infiltration of Sumerian culture, human evolution has been a continuing drama of conflict and chaos. (RE: Voyagers Volume- 2, Current Events Update Section) The remaining records of \u201cancient human history\u201d cover a period of time during which competing factions of Fallen Angelic Legions continually attempted to \u201csecure their ground\u201d within human populations, in anticipation of the 2000-2017",
