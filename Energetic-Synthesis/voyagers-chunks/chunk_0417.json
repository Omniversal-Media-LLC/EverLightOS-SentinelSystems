Nuclear energy is also used in this fourth- dimensional system, and they have only partially discovered how to neutralize the waste materials. They have violated and disrupted the natural balances of their oceans with waste treatment and realize they cannot continue this process. Using technology of the Zeta they have instead devised a way of transporting the radioactive materials, in small amounts, into other dimensional systems, through the portals they have accessed. Your system is one of those on their target list for such dumping. This process has not yet begun, in terms of your time orientation, but will be instrumented within the next 40 to 50 years of your time, if your Earth is not shifted out of alignment with this fourth- dimensional time continuum (this time shift is addressed extensively in Voyagers, Volume II: The Secrets of Amenti). Their method seems ingenious from the outside. Understanding some of the relationships between objects, matter and time that exist between parallel dimensions, their scientists have created a way to transmit radioactive materials from their generators, into other generators that exist within a parallel or adjacent time-space coordinate in other dimensions. If this should occur, your scientists would find themselves baffled, as the amount",
