The Resistance forces will not land if they believe their Frequency Fence plan is in jeopardy. If Earth\u2019s grid reaches a 3.75-accretion level by 2001, (which will only occur if 8% of the population assembles the fifth DNA strand by 2001; this is not expected until just before 2012) the Resistance Frequency Fence will not work on the masses. If the Frequency Fence plan can be averted, the Resistance will abandon their direct take-over plans, and resort to instigating Earth changes. If they cannot gain control over human populations, they still hope to stop the Halls of Amenti from opening, so the acceleration of the human genetic blueprint does not take place. The Resistance will lose control over their future D-4 stronghold if present human populations can assem- ble the fourth and fifth DNA strands. For this reason the Resistance has a vested interest in keeping the Halls of Amenti closed. Without the Fre- quency Fence it will be difficult for them to stop the Bridge Zone project, the opening of Amenti and the accelerated genetic evolution it will bring. If they cannot stop these events they will attempt to gain dominion over the D-3 \u201cpha",
