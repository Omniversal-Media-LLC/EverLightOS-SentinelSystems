This opportunity would also be used to begin the reintegrating of the Annu-Melchizedek morphogenetic field, which was stored in Alcyone under the Templar Seal. It was decided that in the year 1398 BC an avatar from HU-2 would birth on to Earth through the Annu-Melchizedek morphogenetic field, then through the Sphere of Amenti and into the Earth. By passing an avatar soul essence, who carried at least 9- dimensional frequencies within its personal morphogenetic field, the genetic imprint deviations in the Annu-Melchizedek morphogenetic field could be realigned with the HU-2 frequency patterns. This process would serve to clear the Annu morphogenetic field of its distortions and reintegrate the Annu back into the Cloister Melchizedek morphogenetic field in the Sphere of Amenti. Following the birth of this avatar, the Annu peoples would be released from the Templar Seal and would be able to ascend to Tara with the unsealed races when the Halls of Amenti opened.
