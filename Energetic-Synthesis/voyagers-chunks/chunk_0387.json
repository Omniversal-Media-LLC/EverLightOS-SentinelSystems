That apparatus would not evolve into the physical structure until the latent codes were activated by the Soul Matrix. So logic developed, but it was at a disadvantage, as the pool of information from which it had to draw conclusions was limited by the biological immaturity of the human form. Frog in a Fish Bowl To use an analogy, logic developed as a \u201cfrog in a fish bowl,\u201d whereas in its youth it could swim around in circles within the confines of its limited environment, but could not remove itself from that environment to discover the world which existed beyond the glass.

The frog presently had no experiential basis with which those mysterious forms could be correlated and understood. In its youth the frog did not possess the physical apparatus that would allow it to escape from its fish bowl and explore the odd environment it could see beyond.
