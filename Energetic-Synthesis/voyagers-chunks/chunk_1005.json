If you are unable to utilize that potential, you will sentence yourselves to yet another 26,556 years in the prison of your Earth school, if your planet could survive long enough to com- plete its next cycle. We are taking great pains to explain the dynamics of morphogenetic waves to you because you are presently within the second ascension cycle of your 26,566-year Harmonic Time Cycle. The ascension cycle began 2194 years ago in 196 BC. The half-point in your current time cycle is 2017 AD. You have 19 years before the first morphogenetic wave of this cycle completes its crest. Do you think you will be ready? If the Guardian races had not intervened, your planet would not have made it this far. 121",
