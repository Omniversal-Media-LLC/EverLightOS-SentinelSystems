  "text": "the human and its three- dimensional world represent one aspect of a reality and identity that is multidimensional. By the way, if you stumble upon and stimulate the appropriate cells within the human organism, you can make people see trees also. Does this mean that all trees are figments of your imagination? That is a very loaded question. Welcome, dear ones, to the science of the subconscious symbol codes, part of the reality construction system we refer to as Keylonta Mechanics.
