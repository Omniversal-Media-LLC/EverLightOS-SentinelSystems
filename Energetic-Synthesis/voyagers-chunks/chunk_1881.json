The frequency bands of D-8 Meta-galactic Core, which accelerate activation of the 8 th DNA strand, transmit through Earth's grid when Earth's planetary core comes into a direct 3-day alignment with the cores of Tara, Gaia and the Meta-galactic Core, as Earth aligns directly with the Holographic Beam. The imprints for DNA strands 9-12 do not transmit through Earth's grid; they are accessible only through the grid of Tara. Activation of strands 1-8 on Earth allows for ascension to the Taran time cycles, from which the imprint for strands 9-12 can be accessed. The human bio-energetic field picks up the DNA imprint through its direct contact with the bio-energetic fields of Earth's grid, which provides humans with the opportunity to add that imprint in its operational DNA construction. The process of activating the new imprint takes place as the strand imprint is pulled from the bio-energetic field, into the personal morphogenetic field, at which point the new imprint will begin manifestation within the operational DNA strands. DNA strand mutations are purged from the race morphogenetic imprint in the Sphere of Amenti and the strand imprint is realigned with the 12 strand DNA pattern by the successive births of the 6 Silent Ascension Av",
