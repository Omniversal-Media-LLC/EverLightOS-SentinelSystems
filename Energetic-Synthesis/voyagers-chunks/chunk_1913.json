Keylons and the Partiki within them are the \u201cbuilding blocks of frequency\u201d or sound tones, which are the core structures upon which matter and consciousness are built. Keylons direct the rhythm of expansion-projection and contraction-retraction of Partiki units throughout the cosmos and within the Partiki Grids of all forms. They set the foundation structures upon which biology and the perception of space, time and matter are built. Partiki units set the base electromagnetic fields through which dimensionalization takes place and Keylons direct the contours of how Par- tiki units will build up into form within those electromagnetic fields. Keylons form the crystalline matrix of electro-tonal energy that runs through all things. Keylons represent the primary tapestries of crystalline morphogenetic matter blueprints upon which sub. particle and sub-anti-particle pre-matter substance will form. Keylons are the fourth step between pure consciousness and form manifesta- tion. 4. Keylon Codes: A Keylon Code is a complex grouping of Keylons that further direct the contours of energy upon which forms are built. Keylon Codes serve to direct the in-\ufb02ow and out-\ufb02ow of Partiki unit energy within the morphogenetic blueprint of a form into more specific patterns, rhythms of mov",
