The aftermath of such a project is always disastrous in the long run, for the planet and local galactic structure as well as for the life forms existing within those systems. There are areas within the intergalactic and multidimensional grid that at different times have literally been blown out of the grid and cut off from the reality fields of which they were a part. Like humans and other biological individuals, planets and galaxies also possess a Soul Matrix, of which the Soul Matrices of all the systems inhabitants are a part. All of these grids or matrices are created through and connected to the Time Matrix. (Error: Reference source not found) The Time Matrix is the energy distribution system which carries life force energy from Source into the dimensional systems. When a planet or galaxy is \u201cblown out of the grid\u201d of its Soul Matrix, which directly connects it to the Time Matrix and thus perpetual energy supply, its energy and its evolutionary potentials become finite. The system falls into digression, and as its finite energy quotient is expended the system has no way to replenish its supply. The existing energy is recycled within the system, but will eventually become negated as the recycling continually reduces the \u201cthrust\u201d or power contained within its particles. The",
