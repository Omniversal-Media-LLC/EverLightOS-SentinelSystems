Following the removal of the Sphere of Amenti 849,000 years ago, the Earth once again endured a series of climatic and geographical changes as Earth's energetic grid re-balanced following the removal of the Sphere. Again \ufb02ood waters rose, covering portions of Earth's surface. In historical record, this time period became interwoven with the early \ufb02ooding associated with the Electric Wars, and a later time period of \ufb02ooding, all consolidated into the story of your Biblical Flood. The Guardian organizations knew that the Third Seeding of the human lineage would have to be orchestrated once the planetary environment re-balanced. But the Third Seeding could not take place directly through Earth's core as the Sphere of Amenti morphoge- netic field was now in the Andromeda galaxy. The Third Eye of Horus portal through which the Second Seeding took place would no longer be useful as its connection to the Sphere of Amenti had been severed, so a new portal bridge needed to be created between the Andromeda galaxy and Earth in order for the Third Seeding to take place. The Third Eye of Horus portal bridge remained open as a passage between Earth and Sirius B (frequently used by the Kantarians of Sirius B for visitation during the Third Seeding), but it no longer connected to the Sphere of Amenti and so could not be used for ascension to Tara.
