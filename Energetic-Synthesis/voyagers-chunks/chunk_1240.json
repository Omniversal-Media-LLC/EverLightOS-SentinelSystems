Earth\u2019s First Transmutative Stellar Activation\u2014The Solar Activation \u2014begins. Earth\u2019s D-1 Particle Base Enters D-4 Time Cycle. The Corrected Fourth DNA Strand Imprint Begins Transmitting through Earth\u2019s Grid and Seals of Palaidor, Amenti and Zeta Can Release from DNA. Solar Activation and Multidimensional Identity Become Available to the Masses. Earth\u2019s D-1 electrical overtone particles in Earth\u2019s D-1 iron core crystal begin to merge with Tara\u2019s D-4 magnetic base tone anti-particles in Tara\u2019s D-4 gold core crystal, transmuting both into their higher-dimensional morphogenetic fields/hyper-space (D-1 particles to D-15, D-4 anti-parti- cles to D-12). This is considered a D-4 Solar Activation as the Merkaba Fields of the D-1 and D-4 core crystals are held within the center of the sun and D-4 frequency transmits to Earth via the D-4 Solar Spiral. All of Earth\u2019s D-1 overtone particles and Tara\u2019s D-4 base tone anti-particles enter hyper-space and the overtone D-l and base tone D-4 Merkaba Fields will open into each other. E arth\u2019s D-1 overtone particle base will have completed its shift into the pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time cycle and Earth\u2019s D-1 base tone particles enter D-3 pulsation rhythm. As Earth\u2019s D-l Merkaba Field opens into Tara's D-4 Merkaba Field, the particle",
