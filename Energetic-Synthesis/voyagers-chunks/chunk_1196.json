  "text": "Opening the Halls of Amenti groups began keying Earth\u2019s vortices with UHF seals to block Intruder forces from using the vortex portals. Guardian and Intruder forces began vying for control over Earth\u2019s vortices. 3. January 1988: Sphere Of Amenti Returned To Earth\u2019s Core And The 12-year Amenti Activation Cycle Began. Earth\u2019s First Vortex Seal-Ari- zona, USA-opened. Amenti\u2019s D-1 Frequencies Began Transmitting Through Earth\u2019s Grid. The Sphere of Amenti returned to Earth\u2019s D-2 core from the UHF bands of D-3, for the first time in about 3,500 years, and began transmitting its D-1 frequencies into Earth\u2019s grid. This began the 12-year activation process of the Sphere of Amenti, through which the Sphere progressively opens its D-1, D-2 and D-3 frequencies into Earth's core D-2 morphogenetic field. This will raise the pulsation rhythm of Earth\u2019s particle base and the frequency of Earth's grid, in preparation for Earth\u2019s first Stellar Activation on 5/5/2000. As the Sphere of Amenti began transmitting its D-1 frequencies through Earth\u2019s grid, the natural seal on Earth\u2019s first primary vortex opened and the vortex began its 4-year activation cycle. Earth's first primary vortex/chakra is located in the region of the Painted Desert in the state of Arizona, USA. (The Sedona, AZ, vortices are connected to this primary vortex and they began multidi- mensional activation at this time.) 4. Septemb",
