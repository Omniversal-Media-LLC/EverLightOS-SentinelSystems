  "text": "The Secrets of Amenti Race strands as their frequency patterns were contained within the seventh strand. Once strands 1\u20147 were assembled an lnterdimensional resonant tone (three resonant tones) was created. The body could then turn into light, pass through the Blue Flame in the Sphere of Amenti and re-manifest on Tara, where assembly of strands 8-12 would continue. By removing one of the acti- vation code/overtone frequency patterns from the morphogenetic field of the Cloister, 4 the human incarnate could not plug in the seventh DNA strand, which meant that the incarnate could not assemble the strands of the other Root Races so it could transmute into light to pass through the Blue Flame. Humans carrying this code distortion became trapped in their matter bodies within HU-1, and the supply of transmuting energy available to the matter body became finite as the DNA strands that would have fed the body with higher frequency energies were no longer operational. When the body reached its genetic capacity for assembling frequency, then the physical struc- ture would begin to deteriorate as the consciousness was transferred back into the morphogenetic field. Following this morphogenetic distortion, the consciousness would birth into its Root Race, complete the 12 family and 12 sub-race transmutation cycles, then run into the genetic frequency block. The body would die and the incarna",
