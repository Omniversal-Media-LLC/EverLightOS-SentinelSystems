Missing Evidence, Particle Transition and Time Consideration 10: Why isn\u2019t there a greater amount of physical, archeological evidence of ancient Visitor contact? It is possible that remains of an Elder Homo sapiens race or evidence of ET, IT (inter- time) or OD (other dimensional) Visitor presence have not been found on Earth due to destruction of evidence through geological Earth changes, such as pole shift or other cataclysms. It is also possible that the evidence is here but has not yet been discovered. Another reason we haven\u2019t found physical remains other than ancient records and mysteries, could be that members of visiting races returned to the Otherworlds from which they came. Before leaving they may have made an effort to destroy, remove or conceal evidence of their presence, in order to keep their activities hidden from the general human populace. It is rumored that this tactic is certainly used today in regard to Visitor involvement with covert human governments.
