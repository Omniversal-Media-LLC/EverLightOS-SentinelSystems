The personal 12-Strand DNA Template is composed of specific groupings of scalar-standing-waves, fixed points of light and sound wave frequencies, that represent the blueprint upon which the personal DNA, the body\u2019s molecular structure and the embod- ied consciousness manifest. All humans have a common Base-12 12- Strand DNA Template; Maji races, such as the contemporary Indigo Children, have the Base-12 Template and can have up to 48 full DNA Strand Templates, which activate in synchronization with the Base-12 Template. Each strand of the DNA Template is composed of 12 Fire Let- ters. A \u201cFire Letter\u201d is a fixed point of consolidated scalar-frequency that is composed of 12 smaller units of frequency called Vector Codes. Each DNA Strand Template, with its inherent ''Base Codes,'' ''Acceleration Codes'' and ''Activation Fire Codes'' (see \u201cDNA 101\u201d on page 478) rep- resents one ''Fire Letter Sequence.'' A 12 Strand DNA Template thus carries: 12 Fire Letter Sequences (Strands), 144 Fire Letters,\u00b9 and 1728 Vector Codes.\u00b2 The Maji 48 Strand DNA Template carries: 48 Fire Let- ter Sequences (Strands), 576 Fire Letters, 3 and 6912 Vector Codes. 4 The 48 Strand Maji DNA Templa",
