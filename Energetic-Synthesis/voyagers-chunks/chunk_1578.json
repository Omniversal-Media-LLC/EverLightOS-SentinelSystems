UIR would allow the Lyran-Sirian Guardian races to evacuate 50,000 of their ''Indigo Children Maji Grail Lines,'' then the rest of Earth\u2019s populations would fall prey to fulfillment of the Luciferian Covenant agenda. Emerald Covenant Races refuse on behalf of all Angelic Human and Hybrid pop- ulations of Earth that desire to live in freedom and in order to prevent Earth\u2019s Halls of Amenti star gates from falling under UIR dominion. UIR issued a formal Edict of War on September 12, 2000, against Emerald Cov- enant races and the Angelic Humans of Earth. Galactic Federation and Ashtar Command is beginning to mobilize their \u201cHuman Ground Crews\u201d teaching their followers to expect a''landing'' in which ''complete human compliance'' is promoted. The political arena is now being set for the UIR\u2019s intended 2003 Mass Mind Control initia- tive and most humans are completely unaware of what is taking place. Emerald Covenant races are intending to awaken the Indigo Children as quickly as possible. The Indigo Children are being prepared now to run RRTs in order to disengage the Nibiruian Diodic Crystal Grid through which pole shift can be forced and to seal Earth\u2019s portal system from planned Fallen Angelic 2003-2004 invasion.
