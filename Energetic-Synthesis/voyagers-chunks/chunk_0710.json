Without the imprint frequency pat- terns of strands 4\u20146, the incarnate soul could not plug strands 7-12 into the operational genetic code. The Halls of Amenti were sealed to the human lineage by removing from the morphogenetic \ufb01elds of the Third and Fourth Cloistered Races, the activation codes/overtones\u1d4c that would allow the particles and anti-par- ticles of the body to merge, transmute and assemble strands 7 \u201412 into the opera- tional DNA. This morphogenetic alteration effectively sealed the particles of the physical body out of the etheric body (anti-particle body), making the final transmutation of Cloister overtone codes 7-12 impossible. This mani- fested as an energetic block between the physical and etheric bodies within the human bio-energetic auric \ufb01eld, and a sealing out of the Primary D-1 overtones within the base chakra of the human\u2014an auric con\ufb01guration still carried today within the contemporary human. It also created perception of duality between consciousness and body for those baring this genetic configuration. Normally an incarnate would build up the DNA strand of its Root Race then build up the activation strands from its Cloister Race, which would allow it to pull strands 7-12 into manifestation from the Cloister morphoge- netic field. The seventh strand (a primary base tone strand), which contained the frequencies",
