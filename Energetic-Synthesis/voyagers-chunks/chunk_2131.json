Between Dec 2003-June 2006, Earth enters Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maha- ric Seal (dimensions 1-2-3-4-5-6 of Earth Sealed to D-12 sub-frequency bands) sustained by 12-Code activation of Inner Earth Crystal Pylon Temples/Earth Cue Sites #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6. Earth\u2019s SGs and Ley Lines #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6 will be protected under D-12 Maharic Seal. Temporary Level-6 Planetary Maharic Seal will progressively move Earth and Tara into temporary hyper-dimensional sus- pension of D-6 Planetary Hallah Phase Merkaba Vehicle, creating a temporary Level-6 D-12 Cap on the Falcon-Phoenix Wormhole. In June 2006, GA will acceler- ate Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-6 Planetary Hallah Phase Merkaba to Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-9 Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba. Regions of Earth capable of progressing into 2006 Quatra Phase Merkaba will be fully protected from the physics realities of the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conver- sion Period. If Three-Day Particle Conversion Period occurs before 2006, or if regions cannot hold a Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal by 2006, only areas with critical mass Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket will retain Hallah Phase Merkaba/ Level-6 Maharic Seal sufficient to accelerate to Level-9 Temporary Plan",
