Star Gate close as the various Time Continua move past their vibrationally co-reso- nant \u201ccross-over\u201d points , and return to their respective fixed, repeating cycles of vibrational variance. SACs are the periods in linear time when planetary, galactic and universal Time Continua enter temporary Co-reso- nant Continuum Alignment; only during SACs can a planetary body be shifted from its present Time Vector into a Time Continuum that holds a more desirable future outcome. If contemporary humanity can fulfill its intended Fourth Round role within the Christos Realignment Mission during the 2000-2017 SAC, we will be able to establish a literal, inter-dimensional electromagnetic Trans- Time Connection from our present period, to the SACs taking place in 288",
