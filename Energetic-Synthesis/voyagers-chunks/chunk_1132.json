  "text": "Earth as your half-cycle period approaches and the Bridge Zone Project goes into operation. We have said that Earth\u2019s accretion level will be shifted from its present 2.5 level to that of 3.5 accretion. The present 2.5-accretion level is the measurement of the fre- quencies contained within Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field. Accretion level 2.5 is also the measurement of the beginning of Earth\u2019s atmospheric body, the part which is closest to Earth\u2019s surface. Earth\u2019s atmospheric body represents the portions of the D-3 Uni fied Field that have not yet been pulled into Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field, the particle fields of D-3 that exist outside of Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field and thus outside of Earth\u2019s physical body structure. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is composed of the upper frequency bands of D-3, which represent the 2.5 \u20143-accretion levels. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is thus said to be at 2.5 accretion. 165",
