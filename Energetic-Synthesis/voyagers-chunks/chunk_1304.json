The primary par- ticle base and morphogenetic field of Earth, which are holding the 3.5 fre- quency, will shift into the pulsation rhythm of the Bridge Zone time continuum, instead of returning to the pulsation rhythm of the D-3 time cycle. The Bridge Zone time continuum represents a 2213-year leap forward in space-time. Time-Leap Mechanics The Bridge Zone Earth jumps from its natural 2.5 accretion level to the 3.5 accretion level, which constitutes a 22l3-year leap forward in the tracks of time. Normally Earth would reach the three accretion level dur- ing the second morphogenetic wave 2213 years in the future in 4230 AD, at which point it would naturally transition into the first D-4 time cycle. 225",
