Earth will complete its D-6/D-7 Violet Wave Infusion, and begin its D-7/D-8 Gold Wave Infusion in 6/2010. 18. 2006: Dracos-Zeta Resistance to Begin Broadcasting Holographic Inserts, if Frequency Fence is Established in 2004. Dracos-Zeta Resistance plans to begin broadcasting mass Holographic Inserts through their Frequency Fence in order to direct populations away from the path of ascension and to establish full covert control over global social and economic structures. Once populations are under perceptual control Resistance members can walk among humans undetected. They plan to create various types of geographical disturbances that interfere with the grid merger between Earth and Tara. If it was not for the Bridge Zone Project these activities could have stopped the opening of the Halls of Amenti. The Frequency Fence and intended grid disruptions can still cause Earth changes between 2012-2017, but the Halls of Amenti will remain stable as long as Earth's core morphogenetic field reaches the 3.5 accretion level necessary for Earth to enter the Bridge Zone pulsation rhythm in 2012. Only the phantom Earth that returns to the D-3 time cycle after 2017 will be susceptible to Resistance control and the massive Earth changes that could result from the Frequency Fence and relat",
