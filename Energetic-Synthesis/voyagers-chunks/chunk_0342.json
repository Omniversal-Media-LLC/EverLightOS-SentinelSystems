Some of these instructions emerged throughout your history within the sacred texts of your major religions and belief systems. As you were led through certain progressions of Earthly dramas you were led closer and closer to the frequencies that would allow you to access the key codes and begin your process of re-integration of the latent Soul Matrix particles. A portion of the disassembled codes from your original Soul Matrices has been recently identified by your scientists, who have labeled this sub-particle phenomenon junk DNA. This is \u201cno junk\u201d! But instead part of the heritage that will one day led you back to the wholeness of your identity. The key codes of access that were removed and placed in storage were kept separate from the base imprint of your DNA (and thus out of your perceptual range) by the employment of a Frequency fence. This frequency fence was created through \u201csplicing out\u201d' certain configurations within the stored key codes, then linking together those portions that were taken out, disconnecting them from the stored key codes. This created a literal barrier in minute sound particles that kept your base DNA from picking up the contents of the \u201celectrified sound signals\u201d that were stored. This is a",
