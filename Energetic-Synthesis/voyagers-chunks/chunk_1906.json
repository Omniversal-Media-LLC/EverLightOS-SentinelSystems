To begin utilizing the potentials of Keylontic Science for personal devel- opment, we must become aware of the basic components of which our bodies, minds, consciousness and spirit are composed. Once we are aware of our per- sonal energetic composition, we can begin to learn how to direct our inher- ent energy to affect desired change within the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of our existence. Keylontic Science offers us the oppor- tunity to explore and utilize the portions of our personal reality that presently remain hidden from our conscious view. The basic principle in using Keylon- tic Science is to understand the mechanics by which the elements of Keylon- tic Science interrelate with the components of multidimensional anatomy. The first step in the study of Keylonta is becoming familiar with the six pri- mary elements of Keylontic Science. SIX PRIMARY ELEMENTS OF KEYLONTIC SCIENCE 1. Partiki: Partiki represent the units of crystalline morphogenetic sub- stance out of which particles and anti-particles emerge. Partiki are units of electro-tonal energy-identity that emanate from a central cosmic source called the Yunasai. Partiki are the primary units of energy that form all mat- ter, anti-matter, pre-matter and non-matter su",
