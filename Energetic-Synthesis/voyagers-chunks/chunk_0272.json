The majority of Zeta in your system now work toward brotherhood, and with the Aethien, Ranthia and others offer whatever assistance they can to humans on the quest of enlightenment. Most Zeta can be trusted, but it is difficult for them to convey this sentiment to those humans they interact with because they are so often met with fear, anger and violent reactions due to human misunderstanding. Even though most Zeta can now be trusted in their dealings with humans, there are certain factions of the race who have not yet agreed to the new agenda. We refer to these factions simply as the \u201cunenlightened Zeta.\u201d The unenlightened ones are those responsible for numerous abductions in which pain was caused to the human; not merely frightening encounters and mild testing, but actual physical or mental harm. We are not happy to inform you that quite a few of your mentally ill population became impaired as a result of the activities of the unenlightened groups. Because soul agreements are not involved in such abductions the Zeta responsible had little clue as to what tactics were useful, and what was harmful. They experimented randomly, such as your scientists do with laboratory rats.",
