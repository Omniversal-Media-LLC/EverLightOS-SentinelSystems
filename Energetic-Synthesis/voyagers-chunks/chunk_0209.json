All of these frequency bands exist at once in the ever-present now, but you perceive them strung out in linear fashion because of the arrangement of your Genetic Time Codes. As your consciousness is fragmented into the various frequency bands, then reassembled into the frequency of your present moment focus, the Genetic Time Codes sort and organize this electrically coded experiential data into a pattern that your conscious mind can synthesize into linear, sequential reality. The other frequency (which is conceptually synonymous with \u201cother time\u201d) events are translated, through the biology, into \u201cremembered action\u201d and the \u201cresult of that action\u201d, which sets in motion the body's innate sensory-projection mechanisms that create the physically observable manifestation. The important thing for you to realize is that such abduction experiences are quite real and valid, just as real as any seemingly \u201cnormal\u201d event within your three-dimensional reality. Both types of events, however, employ mechanics that you are presently unaware of, but in the case of the abductions you get a little more of a glimpse as to how these mechanics operate. To understand the nature of abductions you will begin to find a greater understanding of the nature of three- dimensional reality. Not all abduction cases involve the transmigration (movement) of the physical body t",
