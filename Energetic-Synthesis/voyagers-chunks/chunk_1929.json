The Third Seeding 75,000 years ago to present, Root Races Three: Lemurians, Four: Atlanteans and Five: Aryans and their Cloisters. Welcome to the Fifth World! Between 5/ 5/2000-2017 Earth will make its transition from the present Fourth World of the D-3 time cycle, into the Fifth World of the Bridge Zone and Taran ascension time cycles. Due to the Guardians' Bridge Zone Project , the cataclysmic events originally associated with the ''end times'' prophecies have been largely avoided. Though there may still be warfare and geographi- cal changes in some areas, the scale of these events will be much smaller than those foretold through ancient prophecies. There will indeed be a ''cleans- ing,'' as predicted by some Native American traditions. As the Earth sepa- rates into higher and lower vibrating particle bases, Bridge Zone Earth and Phantom Earth each will be ''cleansed'' of the other. Populations of the Bridge Zone Earth will rise to face a new dawn of evolution within the new Fifth World of enlightenment, progress and achievement. Those on Phantom Earth will not make this transition and will remain within the digressing Fourth World evolutionary cycle of a Descending Planet in the D-3 time con- tinuum. 462",
