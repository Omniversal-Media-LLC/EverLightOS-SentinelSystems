However, while your con- sciousness is focused within the multiple layers of dimensional reality, the concepts of space, time, matter and movement will indeed appear to apply, so we will continue our discussion following that paradigm of perception. You can begin to stretch your perceptual and conceptual fields by simply pondering the following concepts and allowing your intuitive senses to bring to you a sensed cognition of these realities of which we speak. When you look at your Sun from the third dimension, you are seeing the D-1 Merkaba Field of Earth and her sister planets. From the D-3 frequency level, when you view the D-2 Merkaba Field surrounding Earth\u2019s iron core crystal, which holds Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field, it appears to be the solid matter makeup of your Earth\u2019s body and elemental/telluric kingdom. From the D-3 view, the D-3 Merkaba Field is the Earth\u2019s atmosphere within which your present reality takes place. The distance of outer space that you perceive between Earth, the Sun and the planets represents the magnetic repulsion zone that separates the D-1, D-2 and D-3 frequency bands of HU-1 from the counter-rotating D-4, D-5 and D-6 fre- quency bands of HU-2. All dimensions exist in the same space, but seem to operate separately due to the particle",
