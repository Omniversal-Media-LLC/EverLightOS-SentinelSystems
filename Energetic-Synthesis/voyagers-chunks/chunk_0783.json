If 8% of the races could assemble the fourth DNA strand and increase the vibration rate/particle pulsa- tion rate of their personal bodies and bio-energetic fields, the particles of Earth's grid would also accelerate to D-4 frequencies, high enough to hold the Sphere of Amenti with its fourth-dimensional frequency coding. Once the Sphere of Amenti was returned to Earth's core the souls of the Second Seeding races could return to their morphogenetic fields upon death and would no longer suffer the fragmentation of consciousness into the D-4 astral and D-2 elemental kingdoms. With the return of the Sphere morphogenetic field the memory of the races would be re-entered into Earth's grid and the strand parti- cles of DNA that brought that memory imprint into the personal cellular mem- ory would reassemble within the operational DNA strands of the entire fifth race, returning to the incarnates the memory of their place and purpose within the evolutionary drama. Opening the Sphere of Amenti within the Earth's core would automatically accelerate the process of building DNA strands and incar- national evolution for all of the races, and for those who completed assembly of the fourth strand the Seal of Amenti would be released, allowing for a",
