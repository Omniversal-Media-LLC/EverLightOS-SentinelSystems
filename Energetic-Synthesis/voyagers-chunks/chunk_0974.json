  "text": "Earth Time Cycles and Primary Coordinate Points occur, are collectively referred to as Ascen- sion Cycles. Ascension cycles occur only twice within a 26,556-year Har- monic Time Cycle. Earth fuses with its double twice within the first 4,426 years after entering a 26,556-year Harmonic Time Cycle. Earth fuses twice with its counterpart double parallel Tara, once after being in the 26,556-year cycle for 24,343 years (half-cycle Coordinate Point in the second ascension cycle) and once after completing the full 26,556 years of the Harmonic Time Cycle, at the end of the second ascension cycle. When Earth encounters its first Coordinate Point within the second Ascension Cycle, all of its particles that are composed of the overtone fre- quencies of dimensions one, two and three merge and fuse with the anti-par- ticles of parallel Tara that are composed of the base-tone frequencies of dimensions four, five and six within the parallel dimensional scale of HU-2. As Earth\u2019s particles fuse with Tara\u2019s anti-particles, both particles and anti-par- ticles enter hyper-space; they momentarily return to their higher-dimem sional morphogenetic fields. Earth\u2019s D-1 overtone particles return to their D- 15 morphogenetic field, the D-2 particles return to D-14 and D-3 particles return to D-13. Tara\u2019s D-4 anti-particles return to their morphogenetic fields in D-12, the D-5 anti-particles return to D-1",
