It is the ability, present on a cellular level, to filter energy and frequency, create energetic imprints of that filtered energy and translate the imprints into \u201cpackages of perception\u201d that are then used to feed information to the other senses. All body mechanisms are regulated through this facility within the human organism, and it allows for the development of tremendous potentials within the human species. The Zeta biology is set up differently. As we previously described the Zeta presently involved with your system are mutations from their original form. That mutation occurred as a result of their experiments in dimensional blending. Originally they did possess a sense facility similar to that of the human emotive structure, which allowed them greater freedom to connect with the universal energy-grid structures that support the third dimension. With the mutation they lost this ability. They became trapped within their own biology and their soul identities became severed from the greater structures from which they had been created. The Zeta were, in essence, cut off from their central power source. Their species became disconnected from the Soul Matrix.",
