Originally the human Instinctual Mind was intended to hold the individuated identity in place while keeping the identity intimately connected to the Soul Matrix and to the guiding impulses of the Superconscious Mind. Due to ancient DNA manipulations of the human gene code the electrical impulses from the Soul Matrix are unable to fully process into the Cellular Memory of the body. The impulses \u201cpool\u201d within the bio-energetic field creating an area of disorganized, chaotic energy between the body, personality and Soul Identity. This area of chaotic energy represents the first level of dream reality that the consciousness will encounter as it disassociates from the Body Consciousness during sleep. The Instinctual Mind sets the organizational sequence of memory as it will be programmed into the body.
