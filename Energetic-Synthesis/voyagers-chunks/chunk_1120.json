During the 10-year period surrounding the half-point, all of the electrical overtone particles that Earth had pulled in from dimensions 1, 2 and 3 and stored in the morphogenetic field, are trans- muted through their anti-particles and transferred into the morphogenetic field of Tara in HU-2. At the completion of the ascension cycle, 2213 years later, the same pro- cess occurs with the magnetic base tone particles within Earth\u2019s morphoge- netic field. The particles of Earth\u2019s counterclockwise-rotating, magnetic Merkaba Fields, of D-1, D-2 and D-3, open and merge with the particles of Tara\u2019s electrical clockwise-rotating Merkaba Fields of D-4, D-5 and D-6. Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field fully merges with that of Tara and Earth leaves the time continua of HU-1 and shifts into the time continua of HU-2. Earth becomes Tara. During this process, the consciousness stationed within the three levels of Earth\u2019s body, the six time continua of Earth\u2019s HU-1 Euiago cycle, also transmutes and transfers into the time cycles of HU-2. A planet\u2019s shift from the time cycles of one Harmonic Universe into the time cycles of the next Harmonic Universe usually takes place in two phases. The overtone particle base transfers at the half-ascension cycle point and the magnetic par- ticle base shif",
