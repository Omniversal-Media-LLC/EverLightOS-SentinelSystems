The Dracos-Zeta Resistance is presently quite aware of the Guardian\u2019s Bridge Zone plan, but they are confident that humanity will be unable to rise to the occasion and feel sure their infiltration plan will be successful. The Guardians believe humanity can indeed pull together and make the Bridge Zone project a success. For this reason we of the Guardian Alliance bring to you this hidden knowledge, so that you may be prepared to make a stand on behalf of your own evolution and freedom. 141",
