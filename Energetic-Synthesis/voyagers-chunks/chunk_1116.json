  "text": "you must learn de-manifestation skills. Learning how to remove undesirable morphogenetic thought-form patterns from your active holographic program, which is stored within the cells and made oper- ational through the DNA, is the first step in gaining mastery over the contents of your external reality field. By removing slower-pulsating particles from your body systems, you make room for the addition of new morphogenetic thought-form patterns composed of faster pulsating particles, which contain the electromag- netic imprint for more harmoniously ordered events. We are telling you of these things because the Guardian Alliance needs your help to ensure the success of the Bridge Zone Project. We need you to take responsibility for consciously building your personal DNA, expanding your consciousness, clearing your cellular memory and directing your thought-forms to the Bridge Zone. 159",
