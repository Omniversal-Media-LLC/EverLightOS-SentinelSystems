They represented the Earthly counterparts to the larger Palaidorian group from HU-2. Of the original Turaneusiam-1 12-strand DNA package, each Palaidorian race held the morphogenetic imprint for DNA strands 7-12 (which held the electro-tonal frequencies corresponding to dimensions 7- 12), plus the imprint for strand l, and each of the five groups carried the imprint for one additional DNA strand corresponding to dimensions 2,3,4,5 and 6 .
