  "text": "iverse Merk- aba Fields combine to form the largest Merkaba Field, the Meta-galactic Merkaba Field. The Meta-galactic Merkaba Field is composed of a 15- dimensional, inverted, counterclockwise spiraling magnetic field and an upright, 15-dimensional clockwise spiraling electrical field. The magnetic spiral extends from D-1 upward through the Meta-galactic Core at D-8 and into the 15th dimension. This spiral of magnetic energy serves to draw elec- trical energy from the anti-particle universe through the dimensional mor- phogenetic fields in D-9 through D-15, into dimensions 1 through 7 of the particle universe, then back into the Meta-galactic Core. The electrical spiral extends from D-15, downward through the Meta-galactic Core and into D-1. 127",
