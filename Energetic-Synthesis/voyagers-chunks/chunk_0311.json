This energy buildup would follow the path of the particles carrying its code. The human who had been \u201ctransplanted\u201d to another matrix structure would be natural receiver of this energy. As the biological structure of the human is \u201cclose circuited\u201d into the new matrix, the energy would then be drawn into the other dimensional Earth version, or \u201cparallel universe,\u201d and to the individual residing in that system who represents the implied counterpart to the human living within your system. We will not go into the mechanics of universal physics in this transmission, so it is enough that we say here that you have a \u201creflection,\u201d \u201cdouble,\u201d or \u201cdoppleganger\u201d (as some in your system call it), residing within a parallel system, that represents the \u201cantiparticle\u201d to your \u201cparticle.\u201d This double is often called the \u201clight body\u201d in your times, or sometimes the \u201cshadow.\u201d Both terms can be misleading so we will use the terminology with which we are familiar. We refer to the double as the Dolar Imprint or Dolus for short. In other writings we will elaborate upon the Dolus and its counterpart. For now, what you need to know to follow our",
