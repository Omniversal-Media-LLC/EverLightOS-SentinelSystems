  "text": "l aspects of human DNA are built upon this morphogenetic template of 12 Base Codes and 12 Acceleration Codes. The DNA Base Codes in one DNA strand represent the 12 magnetic base tone frequencies of one dimension that corresponds to that strand and the DNA Acceleration Codes represent the 12 electrical overtone frequencies contained in one dimensional band. The electrical overtone frequencies of a dimension correspond to the magnetic base tone frequencies of that dimension's anti-particle counterpart in the parallel universe. The 24 Seed Codes of one DNA strand serve to set the body\u2019s particle and anti-particle content into the dimensional band corresponding to that DNA strand, in both the particle and anti-particle universe. Each set of Base Codes and Acceleration Codes in one DNA strand is controlled by one Seed Crystal Seal, which serves to keep the particle Base Codes and anti-particle Acceleration Codes of the DNA strand separate, thereby maintaining the body\u2019s particle base within the pulsation rhythms of that dimension. Release of the Seed Crystal Seal allows Base Codes and Accel- eration Codes in the DNA to fuse or \u201cplug into each other\u201d and accelerate in pulsation rhythm. This allows the body\u2019s particle and anti-particle base in that dimension to fuse and accelerate in pulsation rhythm. The fusion of DNA Base Codes and Acceleration Codes causes minute crystalline struct",
