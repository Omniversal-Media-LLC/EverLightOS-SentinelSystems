Maji with 36- Strand DNA Templates have 2592 selves in 2592 Time Vectors in one Planetary 12-Cycle and 5184 selves in the Two Planetary 12-Cycles. 48- Strand DNA Template Maji have 3456 selves in one 12-Cycle and 6912 selves in the two 12-Cycles. \u2022 Each of our 1728 Angelic Human selves in their respective Time Vectors is interconnected with each other across time through a shared DNA Template. When activated, the 12-Strands of the 12-Strand DNA Tem- plate serve as \u201c electromagnetic windows\u201d or \u201cInternal Star Gates\u201d through time. Through the activated 12-Strand DNA Template, the fre- quencies of energy and consciousness of each of the 1728 selves merge into an embodied, unified conscious awareness. Each individual incar- nate self comes to know itself as an Eternal Christos Avatar Identity that is simultaneously manifesting in 1728 different Time Vectors, wearing the \u201ccostume\u201d of 1728 different bodies and personality characteriza- tions. \u2022 The 1728 simultaneous incarnations of the Personal Christos Eternal Iden- tity represent the ''reincarnational'' heritage of every 12-Strand Angeli",
