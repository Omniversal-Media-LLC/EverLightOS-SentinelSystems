Seed Crystal Seals are considered Horizontal Seals, as they control the horizontal movement of frequency bands, light spectra and particles in one dimension. There are nine Seed Crystal Seals located at the center of nine primary chakras within the structure of the physical body and six located at the center of chakra centers outside of the physical body, for a total of 15 Seed Crystal Seals within the design of multidimensional human anatomy. 2. DNA Seed Codes\u2014Base Codes And Acceleration Codes: Units of minute crystalline frequency that form the morphogenetic templates for DNA strands. The template for one DNA strand is composed of 12 mag- netic particle units and 12 electrical anti-particle units. The 12 magnetic particle units are called Base Codes. The 12 electrical anti-particle units are called Acceleration Codes. Each DNA strand is composed of the frequency patterns and light spectra of one dimensional band. All aspects of human DNA are built upon this morphogenetic template of 12 Base Codes and 12 Acceleration Codes. The DNA Base Codes in one DNA strand represent the 12 magnetic base tone frequencies of one dimension that corresponds to that strand and th",
