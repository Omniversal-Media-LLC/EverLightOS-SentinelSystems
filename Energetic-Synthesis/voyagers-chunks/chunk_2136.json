By the end of 2006 this separation of Time Lines within Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields will be permanent. However, the Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket will oper- ate as a \"carrier wave field\" that will temporarily hold the bi-polarized particle base of Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields, time lines and populations together, in a state of slow-mov- ing particle suspension during and for a time after, the Three-Day Particle Conver- sion Period. This process of SAC physics is distinctly different from the complete, rapid separation of particle base, time lines and populations that would have occurred during the later 2017 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period. All of Earth\u2019s particle base and populations can be protected from falling into Phantom Matrix merger, if full Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba can be achieved in 2006. Popula- tions would no longer separate into the Phantom Earth and Bridge Zone Time Con- tinua as originally anticipated; all would \"make it to the Bridge Zone\" continuum out of harms way. This ideal scenario is not likely to occur due to the continuing counter-activities of the UIR; GA will none-the-less strive to achieve this ideal. If full Planetary",
