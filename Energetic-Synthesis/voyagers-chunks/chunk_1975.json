For now we would simply like you to become acquainted with these hidden dynamics of the science of ascension. DNA 101 Definitions 1. Seed Crystal Seals: Minute crystalline frequency seals within each chakra and auric field level of the 15-dimensional human bio-energetic field, that keep particles and anti-particles in one dimension separated from each other. Each Seed Crystal Seal corresponds to the frequency bands of one dimension and directs the function of one DNA strand that corresponds to that dimension. One Seed Crystal Seal separates the particle and anti- particle units of the DNA strand, keeping the body\u2019s particle base polar- ized and locked into that dimensional band. The separation of particle and anti-particle caused by the Seed Crystal Seal keeps the body\u2019s particle base locked into the time continuum and particle pulsation rhythm characteristic to that dimension. The Seed Crystal Seals control particle pulsation rhythm, keeping it consistent with the pulsation rhythm of the dimensional band in which the Seed Crystal Seal is located. The Seed Crystal Seals control the speed at which the Dimensional Merkaba Fields spin. Release of a Seed Crystal Seal allows the particles and anti-particles of one dimensi",
