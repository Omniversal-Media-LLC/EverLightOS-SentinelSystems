If an excessive amount of D-12 frequency from the D-12 Shield of Ara- matena Universal Christos Blueprint was brought into the Planetary Manifestation Templates of the Earth-Tara-Gaia system at one time, the planetary body would literally explode . The Founders designed the human evolutionary plan with full understanding of these basic principles of Unified Field Physics and Primal Order Creation Mechanics. The Palaidia Urtite- Cloister Maji races, as bearers of the greatest amount of frequency through their DNA Templates, were seeded first. The Palaidia Urtite-Cloister Maji presence served to regulate the progressive flow of D-12 frequency into the Planetary Shields of Earth\u2019s Manifestation Template and to set the Core Template or \u201cKathara Grid\u201d of the D-12 Shield of Aramatena within the Planetary Shields of Earth-Tara-Gaia. Next, a series of evolutionary Rounds would take place, by which Angelic Human races with less sophisticated DNA Templates, and thus less frequency transmission capacity, would sequentially cycle on Earth, to slowly and progressively increase the amount of frequency brought into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields from the D-12 Shield of Aramatena. The Cycle of the Rounds was intended to work in the following manner: The Seed Races with the highest DNA Template frequency transmiss",
