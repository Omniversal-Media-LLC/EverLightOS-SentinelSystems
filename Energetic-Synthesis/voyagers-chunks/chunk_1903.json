The 12 Meta- Galactic Cores of the cosmos pair to form six primary reality fields in which multidimensional reality systems take place. Each of the six pairs of reality fields contains two 15-dimensional systems, that are referred to as 15-dimensional Matrices. In one 15-dimensional Matrix there is one set of 15 dimensions that compose the particle universe and one set of counter-rotating 15 dimensions that compose the anti-particle re\ufb02ection of the parallel universe. All life, evolution and form manifestation takes place within the six 15-dimensional Matrices. The principles of energy and consciousness that form these reality fields are the same as those that manifest life forms and sentient consciousness within these fields; the same dynamics of energy inter-relationships apply to the macrocosm and the microcosm. The science of Keylonta allows us to study ourselves as interwo- ven integral parts of this greater structure of the cosmos. Keylontic Science has many diverse applications from communication, healing, acceleration of the genetic code and advancement of spiritual evolu- tion to the creation of advanced technologies such as manufacture of interdi- mensional transport craft and free energy devices to the maneuvering of time-space portals. Mastery of multidimensional science requires ha",
