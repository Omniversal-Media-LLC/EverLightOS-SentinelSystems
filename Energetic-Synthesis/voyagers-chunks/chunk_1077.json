  "text": "rse, the angular rotation of parti- cle spin undergoes a 90\u00b0 reverse rotation, bringing the angular rotation of particle spin back to its original position. As the planet completes the final two Pardo Octaves, returning from the parallel universe, the angular rotation of particle spin again shifts 90\u00b0. Through the progression of three dimen- sions, or Quadrants, the angular rotation of particle spin has a cumulative shift of 90\u00b0 (+90\u00b0, -90\u00b0, +90\u00b0 = +90\u00b0 shift), so in one Harmonic Universe the angular rotation of particle spin undergoes one-quarter of a full 360\u00b0 rotation. When passing from one Euiago cycle (Harmonic Universe) to the next, the angular rotation of particle spin shifts 45\u00b0. Between HU-1 and HU-2, the 146",
