  "text": "Ascension Mechanics humanity, to evolve out of HU-1 and into the higher dimensional fields of HU-2, the frequency patterns of dimensions four, five and six from HU-2 must be brought into manifest expression within the energetic grid of Earth. These frequencies, or sound tones, must also become operational within the active DNA strands of Earth\u2019s people. The energetic imprint of the DNA is carried within the personal morphogenetic field and consciousness after phys- ical death of the body. Whatever frequencies are contained within that imprint will determine the dimensional placement of the consciousness after death. If freedom from the confines and struggles of HU-1 is what one desires, then it is wise to pay attention to the amount of frequencies contained within the physical DNA, while one is still alive in body. Humanity has the power to evolve consciously and thus more rapidly, by learning how to use the bio-ener- getic system to build the needed frequencies into the DNA. This is a personal responsibility, and although guardians from HU-2 can assist in this process, the ultimate success of DNA building lies in the hands of the embodied conscious- ness who directs this process by the way in which personal energy is used and applied. The greater the amount of the 12-strand DNA imprint that can be activated within the body\u2019s DNA, the greater the amount of conscious aware- ness",
