If the Zetas could keep Earth in the HU-1 time band and gain control of the planet here, they would insure the continuation of their future stronghold on D-4 Tara-Earth. If Earth successfully merged with Tara between 2012-2017, and the morphogenetic wave allowed fifth-dimensional frequency to move through Earth\u2019s grid, the Frequency Fence through which the D-4 Zeta controlled their human populations would be released. If ascen- sion of Earth humans could be stopped by 2012, the Zetas could retain con- trol of their D-4 holding. If humans began ascension to the D-4 time cycles of Tara, their assembled fifth-strand DNA imprint would correct the D-4 DNA mutation the Zetas used to keep their humans under the Frequency Fence. Humans in the D-4 time cycle would be set free if 8% of the D-3 123",
