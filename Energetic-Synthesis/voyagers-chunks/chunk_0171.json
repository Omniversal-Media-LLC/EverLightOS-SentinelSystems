  "text": "u may be having a difficult time grasping the idea that you have been brainwashed, and you most likely do not think that there is anything amiss within the ideas and beliefs propagated by your official outside authorities (government, the medical experts, the economic experts, the defense experts, the scientific community, the religious experts, etc.) The very structure of your daily lives seems to depend upon those \u201cexperts\u201d figuring it all out for you, telling you \u201chow it is\u201d and what is the \u201cright thing to do.\u201d Through these seeming authorities you are taught not to think about the bigger picture, about what reality really means, about the purposes your existence may hold. You are taught to believe that such questions are unimportant or perhaps unanswerable. You are taught to \u201cfollow the rules\u201d as dictated by the majority, to think as your parents had thought, and they as their parents thought before them. This is the program of which we speak and presently for most of you, it operates on a subconscious level. Where did this program of dis-empowering the individual originate? Did it emerge accidentally as a quirk of human belief evolution? How did it come to be that this program of ideas now defines reality for you",
