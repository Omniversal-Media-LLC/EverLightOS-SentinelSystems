Soul fragments would incarnate once then transmute through each of the seven families of its sub-race, then through each of the five Cloistered fami- lies of its Cloistered sub-race, building up the lower frequency patterns (base tones) of that dimension into the DNA through its first 12 transmutations within the families. Next the now-more-evolved soul would transmute into each of the seven sub-races of its Root Race, then into each of the five Clois- tered sub-races of its Cloistered Race, building up the higher frequency pat- terns (overtones) of that dimension into the DNA. In the final transmutation, in which all of the frequency patterns for that dimension were pulled into the DNA and the completed strand assembled, the incarnate then carried the full base tone pattern of its Root Race and the particle over- tones of its Cloistered Race within the DNA. In this final phase, the incar- nate's body, DNA and consciousness would transmute, the base tones and overtones within the DNA strand merging to create a resonant tone through which the identity could merge with the Cloister Race morphogenetic field in the Sphere of Amenti, where it would pick up the remaining \u201cactivation\u201d DNA codes/overtones from the Clo",
