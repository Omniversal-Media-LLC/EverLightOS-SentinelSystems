But the full frequency patterns of the Sphere of Amenti can be trans- mitted through Earth\u2019s grid only during the periods of dimensional blending that occur four times in each 26,556-year cycle. Akhenaton was able to open the Halls of Amenti and orchestrate ascension only for those individuals who had the fifth DNA strand imprint, but he could not release the Sphere of Amenti directly into the D-2 Earth core morphogenetic field to create mass DNA assembly and ascension. During the four periods in a 26,556-year cycle when dimensional blending occurs, certain energetic conditions take place within the morphogenetic fields of the planet that do not occur at any other time. During these periods, the energetic grid of Earth fuses with the ener- getic grid of its double within the parallel universe, or with its counterpart\u2019s parallel double from the next Harmonic Universe up. In the first 4,426-year cycle of the 26,556-year cycle, Earth fuses twice with its own double in HU- 1, once at the half-point in the 4,426-year period and once at the end of that period. These two time periods are called Primary Conjunction Points. In the last 4,426-year cycle of the 26,556-year cycle Earth fuses twice with its HU-2 counterpart doubl",
