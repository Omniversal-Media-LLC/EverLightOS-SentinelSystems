The term Stellar Wave Infusion is derived from observation of the actual energetic process that takes place as these higher-dimensional frequencies enter the auric field. Once a DNA strand has reached one-half assembly, the frequency bands from the dimensions above begin to \ufb02ow in spiraling, ener- getic waves or sequential pulses of energy, through the lower-dimensional Merkaba Fields of the body. When viewed with higher-sensory vision, the energies carried on these energetic wave pulses appear as an infusion of col- ored electricity or light spectra, bearing the hue associated with the dimen- sional frequency band carried on the wave. Stellar Wave Infusions not only affect the subtle body structures of the human aura and chakra system, they directly interact with the physical body construction, and can be felt as infusions of \u201cjittery\u201d, higher-vibrating electri- cal current running through the body cells. As the Activations progress, the Infusions become progressively more noticeable and intense, creating tem- perature variations, changes in hormonal activity, alterations in sleeping and eating patterns, fluctuations in bodily energy levels, change of the metabolic rate, heart rate and breathing patt",
