Consciousness will per- ceive as solid matter and external reality the level of Earth\u2019s body that is one full dimension/Quadrant below the accretion level of the consciousness. Present human consciousness has an average accretion level of 3\u2014 3.5, which means that the energy patterns and activity taking place within the low to middle frequency bands of D-3, between the 2 to 2.5-accretion level, within the fifth time continuum, appear as solid matter, and external forms and events. Present external earthly reality represents the energy patterns of Earth\u2019s body and the Unified Field in the low to middle frequency bands of D- 3, in the fifth time continuum, at accretion levels 2\u2014 2.5. In order to perceive the 2\u2014 2.5-accretion level of Earth as solid, consciousness must be stationed 149",
