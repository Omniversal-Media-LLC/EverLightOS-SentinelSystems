But they did not succeed in creating pole shift and \u201cclearing Earth\u2019s real estate\u201d for their resettlement as they had originally intended to do. The 22,326 BC confrontation between Guardian Angelic Nations and Annu-Elohim/Anunnaki Fallen Angelic Legions, over the destiny of Earth human evolution and control of Earth\u2019s Halls of Amenti star gates, was left in a temporary \u201cStalemate.\u201d Neither side in this polarity drama accomplished what they had set out to do, and both sides required the event of a natural Star Gate Opening Cycle on Earth in order to bring their plans into fruition. To prevent the Annu-Elohim Fallen Angelic Legions\u2019 intended destruction of the Angelic Humans of Earth, Guardian Angelic Nations needed the D-3 Earth Star Gate-3 and the D-4 Sol Star Gate-4 in the Sun to naturally open. Natural opening of Earth\u2019s star gates would allow Guardian Angelic Nations the opportunity to secure Earth\u2019s Halls of Amenti star gates and to peacefully retrieve Earth and Sol Star Gate-4 from Pleiadian-Nibiruian-Anunnaki Fallen Angelic control.
