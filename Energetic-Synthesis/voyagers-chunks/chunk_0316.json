This group of twelve constitutes the Soul Family, and the existence of one aspect (person) implies the existence of the other eleven aspects. The soul family, which we call the Dora moves in cyclic fashion within the Time Matrix. Within those cycles each aspect has its own smaller cycle that constitutes its passage through time, or its life span. There is a sequential relationship to the aspect or Tauren cycles, which implies a correlation between the births and deaths of its incarnates (Tauren/aspects). In the case of \u201csoul robbery\u201d through forced matrix transplant, the early demise of the double/Dolus affects the entire Soul Matrix cycle (we call the cycles of the Soul Matrix the Aundanct Cycles and the smaller aspect cycles the Tauren Cycles). All of the Tauren are accelerated in their rhythms and all will reach depletion of cellular energy sooner than they would have otherwise. All will thus leave residual nadial energy within their respective dimensions which will become trapped there unless at least one of the Tauren are able to activate the center point and accelerate their physical body enough to allow the residual energies of all of the other Tauren to be expanded into their own nadial field. If one is able to perform this feat and complete i",
