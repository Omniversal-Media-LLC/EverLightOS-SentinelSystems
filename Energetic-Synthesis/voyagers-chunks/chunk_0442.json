  "text": "re of the universe in which you live. Though some abduction cases might be contrived mental mal- alignments and others intended hoax, there are many quite legitimate occurrences of actual ET abductions. If you were to use hypnosis as a primary diagnostic tool you would find a vast number of such abduction memories surfacing, even from those who have no conscious recall of UFO or Visitor encounter. Great numbers of your population have been involved with this phenomenon but have no conscious indication of their involvement. An alarming amount of the mental and emotional problems emerging within your populace can be directly attributed to ET encounters of which there is no conscious memory, but only a residual emotional imprint of the events as stored within cellular memory. These stored emotional imprints of unresolved abduction issues exist beneath the surface of consciousness, creating mental reactions and behaviors consistent with other forms of repressed trauma. Until you realize that \u201cVisitor\u201d abduction is a primary subject to which you should look for cause of psychological and emotional disturbance, you will be unable to resolve the casual elements of the maladies; instead you will use drug therapies or analysis to treat the symptoms, but the individual will not be truly healed until the reality of the trauma is identified and brought into the conscious awareness.",
