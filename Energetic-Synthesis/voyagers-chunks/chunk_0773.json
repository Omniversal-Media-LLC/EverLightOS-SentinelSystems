It is through this process of building dimensional frequen- cies into the morphogenetic \ufb01eld, through the merging of particles and anti-particles, that matter forms evolve up through the dimensional scale. Tara and Earth will merge through this process, as Earth moves upward into the dimensional fre- quency bands in which Tara's matter-body is positioned. When the frequency bands of Earth and Tara merge, changes will take place within the matter-body of Earth. New land masses will begin to rise in the oceans, new waters will emerge in places where they were not. But this process does not take place all at one. Planetary ascension takes millions or billions of years. Planetary ascension takes place in waves. All planets evolve 40",
