For a period of five years before the half-point, Earth\u2019s grid begins to intersect with that of Tara, as Earth\u2019s D-1 particles shift into the pulsation rhythm of the D-4 time continuum. Following the half- point, scheduled for 2017 AD, Earth would naturally begin returning to the D- 3 - D-1 pulsation rhythms of the HU-1 time cycle. The Dracos-Zeta Resistance plans to broadcast the EM pulses of their Frequency Fence through the pulsa- tion rhythms of HU-l dimensional frequency bands. The Bridge Zone Project will allow the primary particle base of Earth to remain at a higher level of pulsation within the Bridge Zone time continuum, at the point Earth would normally begin to slow in pulsation rhythm and revert back into the HU-l time cycles. The Earth must begin its ascent into the HU- 2 particle pulsation rate now, its D-1 particle base accelerating to the D-4 rhythm, in order for the entire grid (both electrical overtone and magnetic base tone particles) to shift into the D-4 time cycle. Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field will temporarily reach a stable 4-accretion level, the accretion level of the D-4 time cycle, by 2012. Acceleration of the particle pulsation rhythm of Earth\u2019s grid into the D-4 rhythm is a normal part of the ascension cycle process. For the Bridge Zone project to succeed, this acceleration must be intense enough to raise both o",
