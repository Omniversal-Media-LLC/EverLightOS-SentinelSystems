  "text": "15 and September 3, 2001, the UIR fully activated the Montauk-Phi-Ex-Falcon wormhole Port Interface Atlantian Pylon Implant Network (APIN) system, launching the sub-space sonic-scalar amplification pulse that passed through the Star Gate-2 Gru-AL Point in Sarasota, FL, on the evening of September 3, 2001, on its way to the Bermuda Base (see page 408). On the evening of September 3, 2001, Organic Star Crystal Seal-4 (which does not have a Jehovian Seal companion) activated as we gathered at Sarasota Beach following our Labor Day workshops to conduct an RRT to assist the GA in balancing the Organic Seal-4 frequencies as they emerged. Just prior to our initiation of the RRT, the sonic amplification pulse, 4 transmitted from \u201cCue Site-4\" Central Mexico via the Nibiruian Crystal Temple Network at Chihuahua, Mexico, rumbled through the Gru-AL Point off the coast of Sarasota Beach. CLIMATIC DISTURBANCES AND THE LABOR DAY 2001 SONIC PULSE INTERFERENCE As Organic Seal-4 began to open, the UlRs contrived sonic pulse, carrying a \u201cPhantom Pulse\u201d with reversed ARPS , ran through the Gru-AL and through the Bio-energetic Fields of the RRT group. 5 When the sonic pulse intercepted the natural current emerging from Organic Seal-4, it reversed the Seal-4 current to the Phantom Pulse ARPS. Reversal of the stronger Organic Seal-4 current, instantly began to reactivate the reverse- ARPS frequencies",
