The Annu-Melchizedek race, housing incarnations of non- human Fallen Angelic souls on Emerald Covenant \u201cRedemption Contracts,\u201d resembled the Angelic Human 12-Tribe races because five of 12 Human DNA Strand Templates were genetically engineered into bonding with the hybrid DNA. From the E-Luhli-Levi stage, the hybrid races could, but were not intended to , naturally procreate with the Human race, due to the compatibility of the lower DNA Strand Templates between hybrids and Humans. This made the hybrid races, especially, the most evolved Annu- Melchizedeks, a prime target for Fallen Angelic races that desired to incarnate their presence on Earth in quest of Halls of Amenti dominion. By the later Atlantian period of 10,500 BC, the number of Fallen Angelic Annu-Melchizedek Leviathan (of E-Luhli-Levi) hybrid family lines, born of Fallen Angelic raiding of the hybridization program, exceeded those of the Emerald Covenant Human and Maji-Indigo races. Throughout much of pre- ancient history, Earth\u2019s Star Gate system remained open, and interstellar commerce was commonplace.
