  "text": "Six Primary Elements of Keylontic Science All things are eternally, energetically connected to the energy-identity of the Yunasai/God through the electro-tonal, electromagnetic reality of the Partiki Grids. Following the pattern of organizational intelligence set by the Yunasai and carried within the Partiki units, Partiki Grids draw in more units of Par- tiki from the Unified Field, forming more complex geometrical arrangements of Partiki Strands which become the crystalline dimensionalized templates upon which all forms are constructed. Partiki strands represent the fibers out of which individuated morphogenetic fabrics are woven and are the second state of being between pure conscious energy-identity and manifestation of form. Partiki Grids represent the morphogenetic fabrics into which tapestries of crys- talline matter blueprints are laid and are the third state of being between pure con- sciousness and manifestation of form. 3. Keylons: Keylons are dimensionalized, geometrically formed Partiki composites, composed of more complex arrangements of Partiki Strands that form around the base structure of the Partiki Grids. Keylons are minute crys- talline structures composed of Partiki that form the dimensionality of con- sciousness and matter. Keylons and the Partiki within them are the \u201cbuilding blocks of frequency\u201d or sound tones, which are the core structures upon which ma",
