  "text": "Earth\u2019s D-1 overtone particles return to their D- 15 morphogenetic field, the D-2 particles return to D-14 and D-3 particles return to D-13. Tara\u2019s D-4 anti-particles return to their morphogenetic fields in D-12, the D-5 anti-particles return to D-11 and the D-6 anti-particles return to D-10. When the particles and anti-particles again leave the morphogenetic field, they reverse their spin and polarity, shift their angle of rotation by 45\u00b0, and then return to the frequency bands of one Harmonic up. D-1 particles re- appear as anti-particles within the fourth-dimensional frequency bands, D-2 particles re-appear as anti-particles within the fifth-dimensional frequency bands and D-3 particles re-appear as anti-particles within the D-6 frequency bands. Earth\u2019s particles shift from HU-1 into Tara in HU-2. Tara\u2019s anti-parti- cles also reverse spin and polarity, and re-appear one Harmonic Universe up. Tara\u2019s D-4 anti-particles reappear as particles in D-7, D-5 anti-particles become non-matter-based particles in D-8 and D-6 anti-particles reappear as non-matter-based particles in D-9. Tara\u2019s anti-particles shift from HU-2 into Gaia\u2019s etheric matter body in HU-3 This transformation of particles consti- tutes a full shift of Earth\u2019s overtone particles from the time cycles of the parti- cle universe in Harmonic Universe 1, into the time cycles in the parallel/ anti-particle universe in H",
