If this should occur, your scientists would find themselves baffled, as the amount of radioactive waste created in your plants would appear to double, with no increase in power output or source materials. The waste materials would appear to you as being intensified in power, or radioactivity. And your technologies are light years away from being able to decipher how this intensification is occurring or from where the increased radioactivity is emerging. Needless to say, such an event would prove treacherous to your system, as not only are you not prepared to dispose of such intensified waste, but your reactors themselves are not designed to process those amounts of radioactivity. Over time, this stress would cause your reactors to explode. Period. The fourth-dimension scientists are aware of this possibility but they are not concerned with these outcomes for you. Their only concern is in being able to shut the portals prior to your systems reactor overloads, so when they \u201cblow\u201d their own reactors will not be destabilized in the process. In their plan your reactors would not overload immediately, as the excess radioactive materials would be filtered into a state of dimensional suspension or \u201csuspended animation\u201d",
