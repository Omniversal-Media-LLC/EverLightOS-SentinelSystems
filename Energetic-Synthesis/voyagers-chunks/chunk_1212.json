Avatar 3 was not due to birth until the year 2000. Knowing the ascension plan had reached a standstill early in 1998, the Elohim orchestrated the early birthing of the third avatar, the ninth-level avatar. With the birth of the third avatar, Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field would receive a sudden burst of UHF energy as the avatar soul passed through the Sphere of Amenti, Earth\u2019s core and into fetal integration, moments before physical birth.\u00b9 ______________________ 1. Most avatar souls do not enter the fetal body anywhere near conception, as the vibra- tional rate of their consciousness would literally blow the physical tissue apart, cause mis- carriage of the pregnancy and damage to the mother\u2019s bio-energetic system. They usually hover about and over shadow the pregnancy, then enter the infant\u2019s body just before it passes through the birth canal. Avatar pregnancies rarely exceed a seven-month gestation period, as avatar-selected fetal bodies have a larger genetic package, tend to develop more rapidly and begin to drain the life force energy of the mother-host after the seventh month of gestation. Most are born as premature infants with soul integration taking place during or just after the birth proces",
