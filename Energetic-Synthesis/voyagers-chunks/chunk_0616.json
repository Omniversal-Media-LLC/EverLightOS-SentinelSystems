INHALE, while imagining that you can see at Earth's core a huge, Disc-shaped Crystalline Platform of Pale Silver Light that extends outward on a horizontal plane through the entire body of the Earth and out into the atmosphere. Visualize the Hierophant suspended in the center of the disc (this image represents the Planetary Maharic Shield, the scalar wave grid composed of dimension 10/11/12 frequency, with the Hierophant Key Code positioned to activate the Planetary Shield.) 5. EXHALE, while pushing your breath outward into the Earth's Maharic Shield, imagining as you exhale that the force of the breath has made the Earth's Maharic Shield begin to spin. 6. INHALE, using the inhale breath to draw Pale Silver Light from Earth's spinning Maharic Shield, into the Hierophant positioned at the center of the Planetary Shield. 7. EXHALE, using the exhale breath to push the Pale Silver Light throughout the entire Hierophant making the Hierophant glow and pulsate with Pale Silver Light.",
