For this reason, and the potential future consequences within the third dimension, there is much assistance being offered to humans, and to the Zeta themselves, for finding better solutions.

There are hybrid babies and children, or what would appear as Zeta- human hybrids if they were within the three-dimensional system. They do appear as such when they are brought into the third dimension to have contact with their human mothers.
