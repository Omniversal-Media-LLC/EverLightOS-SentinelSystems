The DNA Template encoding of each Palaidia Urtite-Cloister race directly correlated to the 12 Master Key Codes and 144 Encryption Key Codes of each Signet Set that corresponded to the Templar Cue Site to which they were assigned. The Palaidia Races were settled in geographical areas in which their DNA Template encoding corresponded directly to the Star Gate affiliated with that location. The five races of the Palaidia Empires col- lectively carried the 12 Universal Master Key Codes and 144 Universal Encryption Key Codes through which the 12 Planetary, Galactic and Uni- versal star gates of our Time Matrix could be brought into remote activa- tion.

In the Primal Order of dimensionalized frequency fields, the highest frequency fields have the greatest power, and thus the dimension-12 Star Gate-12 nat- urally possesses overriding directional power over the 11 Star Gates below its placement in frequency. The 12th Gate in the Universal Templar is the frequency passage that opens to dimension-12 of the Density-4 Pre",
