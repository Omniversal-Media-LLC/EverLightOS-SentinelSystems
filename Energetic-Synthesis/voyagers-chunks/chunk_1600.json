  "text": "who refused to join the UIR are still attempting to orchestrate their original OWO agendas, but all have lost critical amounts of support from Earthly Illuminati collectives. As of October 2000, the predominant force within the covert Interior World Government (see Voyagers I) Illuminati World Management Team is now the UIR Fallen Angelic collective. This ''shift in Illuminati administration'' has already become subtly apparent within the external, political maneuverings of various nations since October 2000. The subtle shifts (and some not-so-subtle) within our global political arena, which have taken place since October 2000 in response to the covert influence of the September 2000 UIR Edict of War, represent only the beginning externalization of the UIR OWO agenda into the visible \u201cOfficial Reality\u201d arena. ________________________________ 2.
