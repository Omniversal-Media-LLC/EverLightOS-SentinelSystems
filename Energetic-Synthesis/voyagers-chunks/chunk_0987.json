The Holographic Beam that was released during the ascen~ sion cycle at the end of the previous 26,556-year period leaves its trace within the HU-1 galaxy. The beam from the past cycle will appear as an area of concentrated photon activity surrounding the planet Alcyone, through which the beam entered HU-1. The Holographic Beam follows a path through the Pleiades to Earth because Earth\u2019s sun is actually the eighth star in the Pleiadian system. As discussed in earlier chapters, during the cataclysm 550 million years ago, fragments of Tara's morphogenetic field were pulled through the center of this Pleiadian star. The planets of Earth's solar system, which are fragments of Tara, then re-formed around this star in HU-1. (Recent speculation in the private scientific communities suggests that our solar system is a binary solar system having two suns. Alcyone, the central sun of the Pleiadian star system is actually the primary sun of our solar system. Our sun is a star within the Pleiadian solar system.) The area of photon energy around the Pleiades has been referred to as the Photon Belt, which was dis- covered by Earth scientists in 1961 through mechanical observation of that star system. (Photons are created through the fusion of multidimensional par- ticles and anti-particles, so the Photon Belt is the residual e",
