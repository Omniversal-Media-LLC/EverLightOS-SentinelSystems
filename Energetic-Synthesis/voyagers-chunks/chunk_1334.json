  "text": "Authors Closing Statement, 1998 me. It had moved so quickly that I could hardly \u201ccatch\u201d any of it to translate into words. The bits of memory and cognition I could retain involved my per- sonal incarnational history and an odd knowing that I had repeatedly incar- nated as a member of a soul group called the Keepers of the Blue Flame. But I would not rediscover what that term meant until completing translation of the Keylontic transmission. I was told in the dream state that evening that the new transmission must be translated as soon as possible and added to the existing Voyagers books. When I began translation of this material, I had no idea how extensive this addition would become or that I would be given first hand experience in the subject matter discussed. From June 27th, 1998, until the day of this writing September 14, 1998, I have spent the majority of my days and nights in trans- lation. Everything contained within the updated material is completely new to me; I learned as I translated. Several times during the translation of this material, I received powerful infusions of energy running through my body as I transcribed, energy that could be seen through inner vision as blue waves of light. Toward the end of this transmission I came to understand that these waves represented the beginning of a Blue Wave Infusion that accompanied my personal Heart Star-Solar Activation.",
