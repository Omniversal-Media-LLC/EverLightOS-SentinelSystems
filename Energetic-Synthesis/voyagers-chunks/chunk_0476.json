That is why you are selected, why you are part of a select group (which does involve some other non-professional citizens) known as the chosen ones. You will be allowed to remember when you are ready to handle that memory wisely, and then your abductions will no longer be abductions, but instead conscious visitations. All abductees and the scientists who study them are being confronted with experiences they must grow to understand, and with a very real experiential language that neither are yet prepared to decipher that preparation is to come. The meaning and purpose of the abduction experience lives within its translation, but the meaning will be lost to you if you do not understand the \u201clanguage\u201d through which it comes. When you look at a tree in your reality you \u201csee a tree\u201d and assume that image is its only reality. You are so accustomed to \u201cseeing trees\u201d that you do not question whether or not what you are perceiving is an aberration or hallucination. You accept the reality of the tree without question. Yet when you see a little grey being with big dark eyes, you begin to question your sanity. Perhaps you have been taught to believe in trees but not in ETs?",
