The Hebrew morphogenetic field was realigned and entered into the Sphere of Amenti about 2000 years ago with the birth of the man who has come to be known as Jesus Christ, and the Annu-Melchizedeks and Templar-Annu were reentered into Amenti about 3,300 years ago with the birth of the Pharaoh Akhenaton/ Amenophis IV . At your present point in history all of your races are part of the Amenti morphogenetic field, and all of you are in the process of healing and assem- bling various DNA configurations. We do not want the more immature among you to misuse this information on genetic lineage as grounds for unfair and discrim- inatory attitudes toward other members of your race, for such discrimination has no intelligent basis and is groundless. We would also like to mention here that of the Third through Seventh Root Races and their Cloisters, each of the seven sub-races within each race carries one of the race strains from each of the seven Root Races. For example, those of the Aryan Root Race affiliated with the Hibiru Cloister, who carry the gene code imprint for the white skinned races, have within their seven sub-races a white skinned sub-race with a dom- inant Aryan or Hibiru Cloister ge",
