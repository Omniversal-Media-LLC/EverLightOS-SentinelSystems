These common interdimensional phenomena (lightning, thunder, magnetic variations, etc.) are actually the residual effect of action taking place within other dimensional fields. As you may now see, when addressing the issue of UFOs you are not dealing with events that have only one explanation. All of the proposed explanations do apply but it is up to you to discover which one you are dealing with in each case. For your information, the US government does possess three- dimensionally solid wreckage from various craft not of human manufacture. This wreckage has come from two primary places, and some of it is not wreckage at all. There have been vessels of transport from parallel dimensional systems that passed through the time and dimensional portal structures and emerged within your system. These craft are not equipped to deal with magnetism as it exists within your dimension, and they most often crash or incinerate upon entry. There are four such wreckage fragments presently in the possession of the US government. Two of these originate from systems parallel to your own and two have come from third-dimensional systems outside of your Milky Way galaxy.",
