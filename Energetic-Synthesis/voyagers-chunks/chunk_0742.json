The Fifth Root Race, which was also born with the Seal of Amenti, held the hope of activating the grounding codes, if they could fully assemble their fourth DNA strand. This would give them astral plane/D-4 mobility of con- sciousness through which they could pass into their Cloister morphogenetic field on the astral plane, then merge with their double there, through which the Seal of Amenti would release from strand 1. Then strands 2 and 3 could plug into their doubles and into strand 4. Once strands 1-4 plugged into each other, the matter particles would begin to fuse within their anti-particles, which would activate or fire the fifth, sixth and seventh grounding codes, allowing the body to fully transmute through the Blue Flame and the Halls of Amenti to reappear on Tara. The Sixth and Seventh Root Races and their Cloisters carried the remaining fifth and sixth DNA strands of the 12-strand package. Neither of these races entered full manifestation during the Second and Third Seedings. The Sixth Root Race are the Muvarians, their Cloister the Melchizedeks, they will assemble DNA strand number 5, corresponding to the fifth-dimen- sional",
