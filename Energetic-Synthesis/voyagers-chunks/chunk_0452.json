There will be some fuzziness of remembered perception in these cases, or sequentially incorrect memory fragments. By looking deeper, beyond the apparent human drama, actual memory of the abduction event will arise. The \u201cbody talk\u201d techniques work especially well in these cases, because the body awareness will not release to the conscious mind data that it is not yet ready to assimilate. If the body senses through its own reasoning facilities that the personality is not ready to effectively deal with the experience, it will not release the memory in its true form. However, if the body is asked by a well meaning facilitator, it will reveal information about the nature of the emerging memories and whether it is using cover memories to disguise actual events. In forced abductions, not only has the memory been potentially manipulated by the abductors, but often the Keylonta Codes within the cellular structure have been altered. This occurs during the procedures of forced matrix transplant, when the abductors attempt to disconnect the human from its organic bioenergetic structure (as described in previous sections) in order to \u201cplug the human into\u201d an artificial matrix or to",
