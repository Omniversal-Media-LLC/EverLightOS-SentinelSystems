However, if the seventh-dimensional frequency bands entered and expanded Tara's morphogenetic field, certain portions of these frequencies could not plug into the grid lines of the planet as they needed to do, because portions of these grid lines had been ripped apart during the fall event. The energy carrying the frequencies of D-7 that could not pass into the framework of the planet's energetic structure would build up within the mor- phogenetic field of Tara's core, eventually causing the entire grid system and the planet to explode. The morphogenetic field of Tara had to be temporarily removed from the planet's core, which would leave Tara with the ability to draw energy through its grid from the Unified Fields of Dimensions 4 through 6, but would not allow any higher frequency energies to enter into its grid sys- tem. This meant that Tara would be trapped in the time bands of Harmonic Universe 2, unable to evolve out of those frequencies until its morphogenetic field had been returned to the planetary core. The planet had to remain con- nected to its morphogenetic field in order to retain its form, but the field could not be stored within the planet structure. The morphogenetic field of Tara had to be placed within the portions of the original mor",
