Tara\u2019s base-tone anti-particles simultaneously shift from the time cycles of the anti-particle universe in HU-2, into the time cycles of the etheric par- ticle universe in HU-3. This is the process by which planetary bodies (and the life-forms residing upon them) evolve their matter particles and anti-par- ticles upward through the l5-dimensional scale, from dense matter solidity to pure, non-matter-based conscious energy substance. Ascension through the time cycles represents the progressive acceleration of particle and anti-parti- cle pulsation speeds, created through the systematic merging of particles and 111",
