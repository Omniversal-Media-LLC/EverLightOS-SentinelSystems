When you relax your mental focus and slow your heart and breathing rates, your consciousness expands and begins to pulsate faster, while the pulsation rhythm of your body\u2019s particles slows. From this quickened state of consciousness, you can then consciously shift the par- ticle-pulsation speed of your awareness into very slow pulsation rhythms. \u2022 First, you will visualize moving your consciousness through a dark tunnel, with a bright light at its end (the same effect as in a Near Death Experience, which occurs for the following reason). Moving into the light represents the quickening of the particle pulsation rhythm of your consciousness, for which you are aiming in this exercise. You perceive the \u201cdark tunnel\u201d as your consciousness moves from its D-4 pulsation rhythm, through the 90\u00b0 shift in angular rotation of particle spin that exists between the D-4 and D-5 frequency bands, and into the faster pulsation rhythms of D-5 fre- quency. The \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d represents the collective re- ality fields of the D-5 frequency bands, (and the D-5 consciousness contai",
