  "text": "base tone particles of Earth, that would normally slow in pulsation rhythm and return to the D-3 time cycle, will instead be divided into two groups. Through beaming a continual stream of D-3.5 energy through Earth\u2019s core and grid via the Holographic Beam throughout the three day period, the Guardians will be able to keep the accretion level of most of Earth\u2019s particle base and its morphogenetic field at 3.5. After the 3-day period ends, Earth\u2019s base tone magnetic fields return and they would normally seal Earth\u2019s particle pulsation rhythm into the D-3 time cycle. By shifting the angular rotation of particle spin 22.5\u00b0 in reverse, instead of the natural 45 \u00b0 rotation, while keeping Earth at a 3.5 accretion level when the magnetic fields return, most of Earth\u2019s particle base will be shifted into the Bridge Zone and magnetically sealed at the 3.5 accretion level. T he Bridge Zone represents the natural time cycle of Inner Earth-Agartha. The por- tions of Earth\u2019 s particle base that cannot hold the infusion of D-3.5 frequency will drop rapidly into D-3 pulsation rhythm while the magnetic \ufb01elds are down, creating a phantom Earth particle body in the D-3 time cycle. The primary par- ticle base and morphogenetic field of Earth, which are holding the 3.5 fre- quency, will shift into the pulsation rhythm of the Bridge Zone time continuum, instead of returning to the pulsation rhythm of",
