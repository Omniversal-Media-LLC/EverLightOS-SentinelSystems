The Holographic Beam runs from the D-8 Meta- Galactic Core, upward into the D-9 Galactic Core, then downward, directly through the cores of Gaia in HU-3, Tara in HU-2 and Earth in HU-1. This creates an infusion of D-8 and D-9 frequency through the three planetary grids, and allows an ascension passage from Earth, through Tara and into Gaia and beyond, to open during the three-day period. The morphogenetic fields of each planet absorb as much UHF energy from the beam as they can hold, at which point the morphogenetic wave reaches its full crest and parti- cle/anti-particle spin begins to slow in preparation for Earth\u2019s return to its HU-1 time cycle. Particles and anti-particles reverse spin and polarity, and their angular rotation shifts 45\u00b0 back to its original position, as Earth begins to shift out of direct alignment with the Holographic Beam and Tara\u2019s grid. After a three-day period Earth returns to its HU-1 time cycle and the time warp portal between D-2 and D-5 begins its five-year closing period, and the portals between D-9, D-8 and D-7 close. The grids of Earth and Tara begin their five-year period of moving out of alignment with each other, and Earth\u2019s overtone particles remain within the Photon Belt. Normally Earth\u2019s overtone",
