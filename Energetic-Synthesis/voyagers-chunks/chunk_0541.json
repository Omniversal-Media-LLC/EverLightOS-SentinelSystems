  "text": "hristos Founders Race seeding took place through the natural Star Gates of the Universal Templar Complex that open between dimensions in our Time Matrix. There are 12 Primary Star Gates in the Universal Templar Complex, each corresponding to 1 of 12 dimensional fields. Star Gates 12, 11 and 10, which serve as the entry points into the Pre-matter Density-4 \u201cLiquid Light Christos Field,\u201d are respectively located in D-12 Aramatena, D-11 Aveyon and D-10 Vega. These 3 Density-4 planets (the remainder of which appears as the star \u201cVega\u201d in Density-1), and the Star Gates within them, are all located with the Lyran Star Constellation. This \u201cPrimal Triad of Creation\u201d has thus become known as \u201cThe Cradle of Lyra,\u201d the seeding point of life in our Time Matrix 950 billion years ago. The seeding of the life-field in our Time Matrix was orchestrated through a cooperative agreement of intended peaceful co-evolution between the Yanas and the Density-5 Emerald, Gold and Amethyst Order Breneau Founders Races; this original Founders Race \u201cCreation Contract\u201d was called the \u201cEmerald Covenant of Aramatena.\u201d Of the three, IAFW, GA and Azurite Universal Templar Security Team, Universal Service Organizations, the IAFW and the Azurites were created first 250 billion years ago, following a series of universally cataclysmic events that nearly destroyed our Time Matrix.",
