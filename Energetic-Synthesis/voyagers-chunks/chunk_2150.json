On Earth, the UIR is likely to succeed in at least partially fulfilling its 2005 First Contact'' invasion attempt within the Trion Zones. If the GA is successful in creating the 2003 Level-3 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal, the 2003 UIR invasion schedule will be effectively postponed, but not permanently prevented. In 2005, it is unlikely that UIR will be able to utilize their massive Mother-ship \ufb02eet, due to the Cap on the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes. The use of smaller craft and a less dramatic public debut are the more likely UIR strategies. (If UIR erodes the Level-3 D-12 Cap on the Wormholes, the UIR \"Mother ship\" agenda may unfold in 2005 as they had originally planned.) The GA\u2019s successful activation of the \"4 Faces of Man\"/\"Guard- ians of the 12 Pillars\" LPIN and \"Great White Lion\" and \"Golden Eagle\" APINs will thwart the UIR \u201creal estate clearing through 2008 pole shift\u201d agenda. The GA LPIN/ APIN systems, coupled with the Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Planetary Buffer Blanket, will hold the core of Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields stable throughout the SAC until 2011, when the only remaining \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to create planetary pole shift arises. Whether the UIR has succeeded or not in progressing to on-planet physical pre- sence,",
