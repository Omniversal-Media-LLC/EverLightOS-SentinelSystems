  "text": "as a \u201ccigar-shaped object\u201d hovering in the sky in your reality may in actuality be a house, a car or a weather pattern from a parallel dimension interfacing with your time-space coordinate accidentally. Such phenomena are not necessarily \u201cvessels\u201d or \u201ctravel craft\u201d at all, but common objects from a parallel system that appear in different form when they interface with the electromagnetic frequency bands of your dimension. In your photographs they may appear as discs or craft, but in such cases that would be an illusion created by dimensional distortion. Not all discs or UFOs fit into this category either but it will serve your research well if you are aware of this possible explanation, for many of your sightings are just this phenomenon in action. Other discs and vessels are actual solid-matter transport devices but these will emanate from within your own dimensional system, either from human-related sources or from sources of an extra-terrestrial nature. To further this point a bit we will add that many of your \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d biophysical phenomena (such as ball lightening) are also sightings of the interdimensional kind. Sightings so common that your scientists consider them part of the organic operations of planetary physics. These common interdimensional phenomena (lightning, thunder, magnetic variations, etc.) are actually the residual effect of action taking place",
