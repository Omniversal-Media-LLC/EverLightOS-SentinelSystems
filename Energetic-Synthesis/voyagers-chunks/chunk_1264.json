The Sphere of Amenti begins transmitting its D-5 frequencies into Earth\u2019s grid as Earth completes its D-4 Solar Activation and begins its D-5 Pleiadian Activation. The morphogenetic wave continues build. The particles of Earth\u2019s D-2 elemental kingdom begin to merge with Tara\u2019s D5 anti-parti- cles, Earth's D-3 atmospheric anti-particles begin to merge with Tara\u2019s D-6 particles. Earth\u2019s D-2 and D-3 Merkaba Field begin to merge with Tara\u2019s D-5 and D-6 Merkaba Field, through the pathway of the Alcyone spiral. By the end of its Pleiadian Activation in 6/2008, Earth will complete the final 2/3 of its shift into the HU-2 time cycles, in preparation for merger with Tara on 5/5/2012. 14. September 9, 2004: Tentative Birth of Avatar 4\u2014Tenth-level Avatar. Will Align DNA Strand 5 with 12-strand Pattern. Corrected Strand 5 Imprint Begins Transmitting through Earth\u2019s Grid. The fourth of six Silent Avatars is scheduled to be born; the birth can occur before this date, following the birth of Avatar 3 on ]une 26, 1998, but must take place by September 9, 2004, to realign the fifth DNA strand imprint in the Sphere of Amenti morphogenetic field, before this strand imprint begins transmitting through Earth\u2019s grid on 9/9/2004.
