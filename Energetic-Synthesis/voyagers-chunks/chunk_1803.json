The second \u201csonic slow pulse\u201d transmitted on August 12, was released northward from the Zeta/Necromiton-Andromie \u201cFalcon\u201d Base beneath Lake Titicaca, Peru, on Axiatonal Line-7. The two ULF sonic pulses interfaced at the Falcon wormhole on A7/L4, and were then further amplified and transmitted via Ley Line-3 to the Star Gate-3 \u201cFalcon\u201d Base in the Bermuda Islands. The amplification pulse was held at SG-3 Bermuda until September 11, 2001. On September 11, the ''Dove '' group (Jehovian Annunaki), using the Phoenix wormhole at A7/L4, and the ''White Eagle'' group (Necromiton-Andromie Alpha-Omega), using the Falcon wormhole, simultaneously transmitted two massive sub-space ''Trumpet Pulses.'' The Trumpet Pulses were projected from the Falcon/Phoenix wormholes through Ley Line-3 to the Bermuda Base. At the Bermuda Base, the Trumpet Pulses were then combined into one, accelerated via the stored amplification pulse and directed from the Bermuda Base through the Montauk-Phi-Ex Port Interface Network and into the subterranean WTC NYC Phoenix Spike location. Moments later the first plane struck the",
