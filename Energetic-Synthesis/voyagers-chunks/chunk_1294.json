Earth will not begin its second cycle of three Stellar Wave Infusions until the Three- day particle conversion period of 2017, when Earth rapidly fulfills its D-7 Arcturian, D-8 Orion and D-9 Andromeda Activations and receives the Silver Wave and Blue-Black and Silver-Black Liquid Light Wave Infu- sions. 33. June 2015: Keepers of the Violet Flame Begin Blue-black Liquid Light Wave Infusions. The Keepers of the Violet Flame are half way through their D-8 Orion- Earth Core Activation, the D-8/D-9 Silver Wave Infusion that began in 1/ 2013 completes and the D-9/D-10 Blue-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusion begins. Through these D-9/D-10 Wave Infusions, D-9 base tone & D-10 overtone frequencies, and imprints for DNA strands 9 and 10, enter the morphogenetic field of the Violet Flame Keepers. 34. January 1, 2017: Violet Flame Embodies on Earth Within the Keepers of the Violet Flame. Keepers of the Violet Flame Begin D-9 Androm- eda-Galactic Core Activation. The Morphogenetic Wave Begins to Slow. The Violet Flame Keepers complete their D-8 Orion Activation, becom- ing eighth-level avatars with the ability to initiate eighth strand Orion Activations in others. They rapidly begin their D-9 Andromeda Activa- tion, which will complete on day two of the Three-day particle conversion period between 5/5/2017-6/3",
