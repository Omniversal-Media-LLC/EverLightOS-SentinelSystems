Planetary bodies and human bodies are multidimensional in structure. The primary morphogenetic identity (form-holding pattern) for galaxies, planets and people is held within the entry point to the 15-dimensional sys- tem, the D-8 Meta-Galactic Core. From that point the morphogenetic design spreads outward into each of the 15-dimensional particle fields. The slower 473",
