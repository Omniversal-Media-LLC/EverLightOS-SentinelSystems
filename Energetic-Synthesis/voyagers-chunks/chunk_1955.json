Earth\u2019s alignment with each spiral of the Stellar Spiral Bridge occurs in six phases, beginning with the D-4 Solar Spiral upward through the D-9 Andromeda Spiral. The point at which a Stellar Spiral aligns with the Merkaba Field spirals of Earth begins a Transmutative Stellar Activation. Between 5/5/2000 and 2017 Earth will experience six Stellar Activations, through which the six Stellar Spirals of the multidimensional Earth-to-Andromeda Stellar Bridge progressively align with Earth\u2019s Merkaba Fields. During each Stellar Activa- tion, the dimensional frequencies carried within the activating spiral begin to 471",
