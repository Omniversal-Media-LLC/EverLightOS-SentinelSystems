They will be pri- vately escorted to guardian Transport landing sites & will travel to Tara via interdimensional spacecraft. \u2022 Once arriving on Tara V oyagers will be given lodging & will attend ori- entation classes to assist them with integration into Taran society as time- travelers from the past. Taran culture is built upon the Law of One & is quite Heavenly compared to Earthly existence. \u2022 V oyagers will find themselves in less-dense, more perfected versions of their present bodies, free from disease, the necessity of death and the cycles of reincarnation in HU-1. \u2022 Humans who have assembled the fifth DNA strand, but whose physical bodies are beyond repair & will not permit the strand to activate, will physi- cally die in usual terms then pass through the Halls of Amenti as conscious- ness, to incarnate into an immortal body through a Taran parent couple. \u2022 In some cases couples or groups will be able to ascend together & will be able to remain together on Tara if they choose to do so. \u2022 Full memory of multidimensional experience will return to the V oyag- ers & they will have open relationships with ET and metaterrestrial commu- nities while evolving on Tara. \u2022 Few will take the path of the V oyager, but it is the path of choice & the opportunity of many life times for those who can qualify. 447",
