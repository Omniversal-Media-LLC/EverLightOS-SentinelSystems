Those who are willing to learn, and there are many, are being trained in contact procedures that do not violate the integrity of the human subjects. The groups who are working toward brotherhood can be easily identified as there will always be among them the Aethien, Ranthian (who sometimes take on human guise during working with humans) or Zionite (as previously discussed) guardians, serving as hosts, advisors, teachers, healers or in positions of command. It is important that humans become aware of the Zeta presence, and learn to distinguish between the enlightened groups and those that may bring them harm. One tactic of differentiation that is useful during abduction encounters is that of holding in mind (Zeta can see your mental pictures) the image of one of the guardian races (see Guardian images, page lviii). If you are dealing with an enlightened Zeta you will be greeted with a response of curiosity and positive acknowledgment. If it is an unenlightened Zeta the reaction will be one of tension and a \u201chands-off\u201d stance, as the Zeta who are aware of the guardians and have chosen not to cooperate are intimidated by them.
