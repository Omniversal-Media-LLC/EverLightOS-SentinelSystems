Original Zeta Agenda and the World Wars We have given you information about the Zeta so that you may begin to understand their motives for involvement with you. Their original purpose involved accessing other dimensional versions of their planet and time continuum by going through your time portals, as they had destroyed their own. If they could move through the dimensional portals of Earth and into a parallel system, then access their own \u201cpast\u201d planet and time continuum from there, they hoped to reconstruct the pathways to their own three-dimensional time continuum\u2014to reattach their three-dimensional zone to the interdimensional grid. They had not planned to interact with you for any period of time Their plan was good in theory but not in application, as the Zeta soon discovered. Though they possessed much knowledge of how the time portals worked in a three-dimensional system, they did not have such mastery over the time portals in other dimensional systems. Large groups of Zeta became \u201ctrapped between dimensions,\u201d and stuck in your time/space continuum. They \u201cleaped into\u201d your system from the third dimension, moving backward in time.
