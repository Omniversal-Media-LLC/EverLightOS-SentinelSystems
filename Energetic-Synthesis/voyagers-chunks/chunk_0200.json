  "text": "Mechanics of Visitor Abduction We have explained to you in the beginning of this writing the different categories into which UFO phenomena may fall, some being benign manifestations of natural phenomena, others being intentional or unintentional contact with sentient beings from your or other systems. We have explained to you that what appear to be solid-matter physical objects are at times illusions created as other dimensional phenomena interface with your three-dimensional system. If one were able to control and direct the movement of an object through dimensions or time portals, and were familiar with the different forms that object takes within the various dimensions, it is possible that alterations could purposely be made to objects by moving them through dimensions. That is, the form of an object in one dimension could be changed by moving it into another dimension for alteration, then returning it to its original dimension where the other-dimensional alteration would appear as a change in form. This process is called transmutation of form, and it is accomplished through dimensional transmigration. Familiarity with this concept will facilitate your understanding of the nature of the UFO abduction phenomenon. If an object existed in the form of a rock in your dimension, let us say, this rock could be moved into another dimensional frequency, altered there, and then return",
