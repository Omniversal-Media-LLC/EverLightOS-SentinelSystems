This slower-moving ULF scalar pulse was simultaneously launched from two locations during the yearly planetary ''Magnetic Peak'' cycle that climaxes on August 12. 5 The first sonic pulse was sent from an area in Central Mexico called ''Cue Site-4,'' an Annunaki ''Serpent'' Base (Thoth-Enki-Zeta Nibiruian Annunaki), via the Chihuahua, Mexico, Nibiruian Crystal Temple Network. The pulse was sent first north, then east along horizontal Ley ____________________________ 5. A planetary ''Magnetic Peak'' occurs when the planetary Merkaba Field reaches its fastest spin rotation, which amplifies all types of scalar projections. Primary Peaks occur between August 7-16, with the climax speed consistently occurring on August 12. Stronger peaks occur on August 12 every 20 years, and the strongest every 100 years. The 1943 Philadel- phia Experiment and 1983 Montauk Project were launched on the 20-year August 12 Magnetic Peak. The UIRs\u2019 intended Dimensional Blend Experiment is planned for the 100-year Magnetic Peak of August 12, 2003. 408",
