  "text": "more human surrogates learn of what is taking place within their abduction experiences and \u201cmake peace with the process\u201d so to speak, more mother/hybrid-child visitations will be offered. Women abductees who feel they are ready can request such a visitation by making their desire known just prior to sleep. The visitation may take place during the dream state or another \u201cconsented abduction\u201d arranged in which the mother's wishes can be carried out. The enlightened Zeta have no desire to create trauma for human females, and they are willing to assist these women in understanding the purposes behind their encounters. The women must take the initiative in this regard, and let their Zeta acquaintances know they are receptive to such communication and contact. Again, requesting contact prior to sleep or during practice of meditation or focused solitude are the most effective methods of communicating this intention. Abductees are continuously monitored by the Zeta and the request will be observed and acted upon if appropriate to the needs of the woman. Male humans have also participated in this interbreeding and many have progeny within the race of whites. It is rare, however, that visitation between human father and hybrid child is arranged, as human males tend to react more aggressively and exhibit less receptivity toward peaceful contact. The males usually have less biological bond",
