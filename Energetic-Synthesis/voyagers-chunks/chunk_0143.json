Not all of these interdimensional phenomena appear as solid objects when they are within the electromagnetic patterns of your world. More often than not light (flashes, forms, pulsations, movements) will be the indication that an interdimensional interface has occurred. Again, as with the solid object sightings, not all of these represent an intentional \u201cvisitation\u201d by some intelligent force. Many are simply part of the mechanics of physics as they operate within a multi- dimensional reality system such as your own. (Physics your scientists are just beginning to discover and are far from comprehending). However, just because some of the interdimensional manifestations are not purposely directed by sentient life forms does not mean that all of them are accidental and intrinsic to natural laws. Some such interdimensional phenomena are indeed directed purposely by intelligent beings from other systems, both of human and nonhuman origins. Some of these manifestations involve the Interdimensional Time Portal System directly and allow humans in other dimensional worlds or time-space coordinates to interact with and study your system. In these cases your UFOs are actually human \u201cearthlings,\u201d but they have their home in a dimension closely adjacent to your own. Some would",
