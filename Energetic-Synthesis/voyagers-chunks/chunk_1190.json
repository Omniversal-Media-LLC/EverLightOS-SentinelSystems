  "text": "Earth would begin its intersection with Tara\u2019s grid, the Blue Flame would embody within the Keepers of the Blue Flame and the masses who had assembled the fourth DNA strand would rapidly assemble the fifth strand for ascension to Tara. The Halls of Amenti ascension portals would open on 5/5/2012 and close by 1/1/2022. Between 5/5/2017-6/30/2017, the Holographic Beam from D-8 would send a burst of D-7 through D-9 frequency into Earth\u2019s grid. This D-7 - D-9 frequency infusion would finalize the separation of the Bridge Zone and Descending Earth time continua, then each version of Earth would move for- ward in its respective track of time. The Guardians would have 10 years, between 2012\u20142022, to ascend as many people as possible through the Halls of Amenti to Tara in HU-2 and three days for ascension to Gaia in the HU-3 time cycles, in 2017. 185",
