Emerald Covenant races could not attempt to dismantle the Anunnaki NET at this time, as it served as a buffer for Earth, protecting it from erratic frequencies that would emerge from the Arc of the Covenant Andromeda portal without the NET protection. Throughout our known recorded history, the Leviathan races grew in number, strength and territorial power under remote Fallen Angelic guardianship. Meanwhile, amnesiac Human and Indigo races did their best to survive on Earth, and Emerald Covenant races did their best to assist them via their limited communicative access through the NET. ___________________________________________________________ The 2000-2017 SAC is the time when the whole mess will inevitably \u201ccome to a head.\u201d ___________________________________________________________ 397",
