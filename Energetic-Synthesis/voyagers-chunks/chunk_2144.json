Portions of Earth and its populations co-resonant to the Phantom Matrix Sub-time Distortion Cycle will remain temporarily protected within the less stable Trion Field of the Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket, the portion of the Buffer Blanket that sur- rounds the more stable 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble Meajh\u00e9 Zone. The Planetary Trion Field will provide temporary protection from the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, and will to some degree buffer the transmuta- tive frequencies characteristic to this event; it will protect these areas from Phantom Matrix descent until 2012. Ideally, the Planetary Trion Field will be sustained by Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-6 Hallah Phase Merkaba Vehicle until 2012, when final transition into the Phantom Matrix time continuum will take place via apparent regional Earth Changes. Areas of Earth under Trion Field Hallah Phase Merkaba protect are called \u201cTrion Zones\u201d. Earth\u2019s SGs and portals in Trion Zones, protected by the Trion Field Hallah Phase Merkaba, will have only a 6-dimen- sional protective seal. Despite GA efforts to retain this protection, UIR forces may compromise this Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal to partially un-Cap the Wormhole",
