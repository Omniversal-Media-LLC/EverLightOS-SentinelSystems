Genetic crossbreeding between an earlier Otherworld Homo sapiens race and earthly primate forms could easily account for the genetic similarities between certain primate, primitive hominid and Homo sapiens species. We may not be the descendants of primitive man, we might very well be its progenitor. This fact remains: a concrete answer to the question of human origins has not yet been adequately determined and the existing evidence can be interpreted in a variety of ways. If we add to the equation a literal interpretation of ancient historical records, depicting Otherworldly contact, (some of which include stories of the gods coming down to interbreed with human females), the cumulative evidence points more strongly to Visitor involvement with our lineage, than to the hypothesis that we are the product of primate-evolution.
