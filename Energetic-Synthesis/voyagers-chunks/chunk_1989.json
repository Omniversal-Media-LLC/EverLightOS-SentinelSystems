The frequencies carried on the Stellar Spirals can then create activation and release of the Star Crystal Seals, which will allow the Seed Crystal Seals to open and the DNA Fire Codes to activate. Through this Star Crystal Seal Activation process, the particle pulsation rhythms of the body and conscious- ness can be accelerated and the DNA rapidly assembled and activated, so individuals may shift into the Bridge Zone or Taran time cycles. Each of the upcoming six Transmutative Stellar Activations will allow various Star Crys- tal Seals to release and DNA strands to activate. A minimum of 1.5 Stellar Activations must occur for an individual to successfully shift into the Bridge Zone. Those who do not make the shift will end up on Phantom Earth in the D-3 time cycle after 2017. Reincarnation out of HU-1 will require a Host Matrix Transplant. Releasing of the Star Crystal Seals of the human body is a complicated process of multidimensional physics. We do not have enough time to teach you of the intricacies involved in this process. For this reason our future work will focus upon bio-energetic techniques you can use to fac",
