The Great Pyramid of Giza and the Sphinx (with its curious resemblance to the Face on Mars) might also represent remains of a Visitor presence. Along with this persuasive physical evidence, we have records from ancient times throughout our known history indicating Otherworld contact and we have literally thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of contemporary eye witness accounts of UFO sightings and Visitor contact or abductions. How can we expect to solve the equation of the human drama while blatantly ignoring the body of evidence that suggests Otherworlds and their Visitors do indeed exist? How can we rationally ignore this cumulative evidence and assume that all of the cultures throughout history and all people experiencing extraordinary phenomena today, just don\u2019t know what they are talking about? How can we ignore the potential connections between various elements of physical evidence and the correlation between the physical evidence and the subject accounts of witnesses throughout the ages? Why would we want to ignore or deny this information? It is illogical and irrational to ignore this evidence. Many people assume that there is no evidence to support the theory of Otherworld Visitor contact. This is an erroneous assumption,",
