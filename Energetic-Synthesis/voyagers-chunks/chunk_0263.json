  "text": "The Tree of Life All beings within the dimensional systems enter those systems through a web work of interconnected energy strands. There is a precise pattern to systems entry, just as your computers have precise codes of access to their operations. If you imagine the structural growth pattern of branches upon trees you can get a rough visual representation of the energy web work we describe. The tiniest bud is connected to the whole through a system of intricate relays or branches. Nourishment is sent to the bud via this pathway, replenishing and sustaining all of the many buds that grow upon the tree. The energy web work of which the soul (and all of its personalities) is a part can be compared to the network of branches in the trees energy distribution system. Like the bud, the soul exists as one expression or aspect of the greater network out of which it grows. The personalities or incarnations of the soul can be compared to the leaves emerging out of the bud. They are birthed, grow and die only to be replenished and born anew within the next cycle of the seasons. As the leaves exist as part of the tree, each taking up a different placement in space but existing together simultaneously following the cycle of the seasons, so too exist the personalities of the soul. Viewing placement in time for the personality as you view placement in space for the leaves and tree will help",
