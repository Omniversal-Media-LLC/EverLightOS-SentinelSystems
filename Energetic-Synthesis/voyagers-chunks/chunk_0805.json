Souls from the Sphere of Amenti would pass through the Arc/bridge as pure consciousness, merge with the Earth's morphogenetic field in D-2, then birth into physical manifestation. A fifth-dimensional security seal was placed upon the Arc of the Covenant, which meant that this portal operated as a \u201cone-way door\u201d; souls of the races could descend through the passageway but could not return to the Amenti morphogenetic field for ascension unless they had fifth-dimensional coding in their gene structure. This genetic ticket to freedom became known as the Shield of the Arc, and the incarnates who bore this fifth-dimensional Shield within their genetic code could pass through the Seal on the Arc of the Cov- enant and return, through Amenti, to Tara. As races 3, 4 and 5 did not have the fifth DNA strand within their genetic imprint, they could not return through the Arc, even as consciousness, unless the Seals of Palaidor and Amenti were released. Release of the Seal of Amenti would allow these races to merge with their anti-particles and pick up the fifth strand, but first the fourth-dimen- sional Seal of Palaidor had to be released. Evolution would take time for races 3-5 of the Third Seeding. Those who could not reenter the Amenti morpho- genetic field would evolve within the fourth-dimensional astral planes between incarnatio",
