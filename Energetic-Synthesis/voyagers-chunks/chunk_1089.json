The level of frequencies accreted into the personal morphogenetic \ufb01eld will determine the level of DNA strand assembly you possess. As you pull in more fre- quency bands from the dimensional Uni\ufb01ed Fields, your accretion level rises, more DNA codes assemble and become operational within your DNA strands, and your consciousness and perceptual \ufb01eld expands. A consciousness with a 3\u20143.5-accretion level has a DNA code with 3-3.5 strands assembled. The strand assembly and activation level of the DNA cor- responds directly to the number of dimensional frequencies contained within the morphogenetic field of the consciousness. The number of dimensional fre- quencies contained within the personal morphogenetic field corresponds 150",
