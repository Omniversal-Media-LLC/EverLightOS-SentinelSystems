  "text": "The Secrets of Amenti Each Root Race was responsible for evolving/assembling one strand of DNA while its companion Cloister Race would hold the imprint of that strand plus strands 7\u2014 l2. The Cloister Race would appear first and through this race its Root Race would emerge. The Cloistered Race broke down into five Cloistered Sub-races, and each sub-race further broke down into five Cloistered families. The Root Race would then break down into seven sub- races, and each of the seven sub-races would further break down into seven families. Soul fragments from the dimension that corresponded to the DNA strand of the Root Race would be pulled from the Unified Field of that dimension into the body form, progressively pulling the frequency bands of that dimension into the DNA until all the frequencies of that dimension were assembled into the morphogenetic field of the body. This process was to be accomplished within 24 incarnations, i.e., two l2-cycles, that were lived in one body. With the morphogenetic field in the Sphere of Amenti holding the pattern for the body form, souls trapped within that dimension could begin merging their consciousness with the new body form, and through 24 cycles of incarnation pull their consciousness into a pattern that vibrated high enough to merge with the Sphere of Amenti. Soul fragments would incarnate once then transmute through each of the seven fa",
