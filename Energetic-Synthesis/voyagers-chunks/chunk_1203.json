The Ur-Tarranates of Amenti served as an adoptive soul matrix through which the lost souls could re-evolve, until they had re-built their connection to their Taran soul matrices through assembly of the fourth and fifth DNA strand. Through the accel- erated evolution opportunity offered by Earth\u2019s present ascension cycle, fourth and fifth DNA strand assembly would allow many humans the chance to re-connect with their personal soul matrices from HU-2. The services of the Ur-Tarranates would no longer be needed, as the humans who made their soul matrix connection would become carriers of the human evolutionary blueprint. The return of the race morphogenetic field to the human species could not occur while the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence remained in place and DNA strands four and five were blocked from assembly. When the Fre- quency Fence dismantled on 12/12/1994, fourth and fifth strand assembly once again became available to humanity. The event of Amenti\u2019s transfer to human guardianship can be viewed as a \u201cChanging of the Guard\u201d. With the termination of the Frequency Fence, between 1/11/1992 and 12/ 12/1994, the Host Matrix Family Ur-Tarranate souls began leaving Earth, as progressively more humans re-con",
