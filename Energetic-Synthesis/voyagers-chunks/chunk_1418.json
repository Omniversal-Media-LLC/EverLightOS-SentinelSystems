The birth sack is placed within a planetary soil \u201cnest,\u201d then into a water or fluid environment organic to the planet, allowing the incarnating Oraphim to adopt the natural template structures characteristic to the envi- ronmental system into which it is incarnating. After water or \ufb02uid gestation, the Oraphim embryo rapidly grows to the size of a human child of 8-12 years, and emerges from the birth sack, fully sentient, mobile, telepathic and with full regional spoken language capacity. The Oraphim race is the Seed Race from which the Angelic Human Turaneusiam emerged, and represents the state of evolutionary fulfillment in time toward which all human races are re-evolving. Like the Azurite Yani, the Oraphim race has a 24-48 Strand DNA Template, which embodies the full spectrum Ascension Codes through which transmuta- tive ascension out of the Time Matrix can be achieved. The Oraphim Seed Race of Tara represents the genetic ancestral heritage from which the Turaneusiam Angelic Human 12-Strand DNA Template emerged 560 million years ago on Density-2 (dimension 4-5-6) Tara. The Taran Turaneusiam Angelic Human is the genetic ancestral lineage from which the \u201cTuraneusiam-2\u201d 12-Tribes Angelic Human race line was seeded on Earth 250-25 million years ago. Contemporary humanity is part of Angelic Human 12-Tribes Seeding-3; the first 2 seedings of the Angelic Human 12- Tribes on Ear",
