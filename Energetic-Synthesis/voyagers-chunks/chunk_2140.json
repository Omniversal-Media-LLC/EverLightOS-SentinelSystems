Fol- lowing the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, and until 2012, regions and populations co-resonant with the Phantom Matrix time line will have greater protec- tion from succumbing to immediate Phantom Matrix descent. These regions of Earth will experience a \"slow fall\" to the Phantom Matrix, with less severe Earth Changes, spread out over a longer period of time, than would have occurred with the \u201cfast fall\u201d 2017 Particle Conversion Period. The ''slow fall\" allows for the potential of retrieving greater population numbers from Phantom Matrix demise. The 4.25 Trion Buffer Bub- ble plan was not originally considered viable, as it required that Earth\u2019s grid speed be rapidly accelerated by 2006 to a minimum of D-9 oscillation/ Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba/ Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal. This rapid grid speed accelera- tion increases the potentialities of greater Earth Changes and possibilities of pole shift before 2012 arrives, which is a risk to all populations that Emerald Covenant nations were not originally willing to take. As circumstances have evolved, the Anunnaki races defecting from the 2000 Treaty of Altair and 1992 Pleiadian-Sirian Agreements have made the decision for everyone. Due to their support",
