Though this manifestation of final conflict is a large and ancient drama that has made its way back to our door, it is not a drama we need to fear. As Angelic Humans, we have the power to serve as healing agents within this conflict, if we are wise and courageous enough to see what is going on, and to assist Guardian Angelic Nations in peaceful healing strategies. This is not a conflict that can be resolved by violence. It is a Victory that can be achieved, but only through Spirit, Wisdom and Love. Becoming aware of the challenges as they exist within the current drama is half the battle won! Over the next 8 years it will become increasingly important for humanity to face the issue of race conflict over the reality of the power known as God. The unfolding drama will force the hand and the answer to the question of \u201cInternal God vs. Externally God Personified vs. No God? \u201d will determine the outcome of the final conflict, individually and en masse. As they have planned all along, the Fallen Angelic Legions are now moving forward",
