Earth scientists observed a rapid increase in solar flares for several days, which peaked on August 7th, with the most intense \ufb02are ever recorded. Solar winds accelerated at an alarming rate in the most intense solar storm ever witnessed by Earth scientists. Published accounts of these observations can be found in scienti fic literature from this time period.
