In researching UFO phenomena the officials tend to look for data and correlations that will prove their own theories and assumptions, rather than investigating the phenomena as an active reality from which there is knowledge to gain. More effort is put into disproving the reality of the phenomena than is applied to investigating what information the phenomena is presenting that will add to the understanding of how reality works. In regard to three-dimensional mechanical UFO sightings the first series of intelligent questions that should be asked involve how the object behaves in relation to the known laws of physics as they are presently understood. Does the object exhibit behavior consistent with those laws, or are there anomalies in its exhibited characteristics that seem to contradict or push beyond the scope of those \u201claws\u201d as they are presently known? If more attention is paid to such questions, the phenomena themselves would lead researchers to add information to their present bank of laws. Time, space and perception are intimately intertwined. Science and physics have already lent credence to the \u201ctheory\u201d that time is not linear in nature as once thought. The mechanics of quantum physics present a solid argument for the curvature of time and the possibilities of",
