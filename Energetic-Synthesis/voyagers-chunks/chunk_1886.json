The Sphere of Amenti served as a Host Matrix (surrogate morphogenetic field or \"form-holding blueprint\") through which the Lost Souls of Tara could evolve and return home. The Amenti rescue mission represents a Host Soul Matrix Transplant on the species level. All present Earthly strains of human have evolved through the morphogenetic imprint of the Sphere of Amenti. Seeding the 12 Tribes of Amenti: Through the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field 7 Root Races and 5 Cloister Races were created, through which the 12 strand DNA imprint could be rooted into Earth biology to evolve. The first 2 Root races were etheric in nature and evolved on HU-3 D-7 Gaia, setting the pattern of the 1 st DNA strand into Earth's planetary morphogenetic field. The remaining 5 Root Races & 5 Cloister Races were to be seeded on Earth & Tara during different time periods. Each Root Race would assemble and evolve 1 DNA strand imprint from Amenti into Earth's biological gene pool. The Cloister Race appearing with each Root Race would evolve the imprints for strands 7-12 as dormant gene codes along with the imprint for the strand carried by their Root Race. The Cloister Races allowed the strands of cellular transmutation to remain alive withi",
