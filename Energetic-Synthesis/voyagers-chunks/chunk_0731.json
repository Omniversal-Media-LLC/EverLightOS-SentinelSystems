Climatic changes again occurred, land masses slid beneath waters, and great quakes rumbled through the planet. Within three years of the removal of the Sphere, a great \ufb02ood came that covered over 85% of Earth's surface. The memory of this \ufb02ood, along with that of two others, was given to you by the Elohim and recorded in your Biblical history as one event. The \ufb02ood of 5,500,000 years ago just described is the first major \ufb02ood on Earth, the second \ufb02ood occurred about 849,000 years ago and the third during the Third Seeding of the Root Races. There were many other periods of \ufb02ooding but these three periods were the most notable. With the Seal of Palaidor came a wall in time behind which the truth of human lineage was hidden. Humans born in the Second and Third Seedings would be marked by the Seals of Amenti and Palaidor, baring the burden of a past of which they would have no memory. It could take millions of years for the Earth grid vibrational rate to rise enough so that life with fourth-dimensional coding (the fifth races) could be sustained and the Sphere of Amenti returned so the Seal of Palaidor could be lifted. Human evolution was stunted 5.5 million years ago and would have remained so i",
