Earth's grid still could not sustain a life field with fourth-dimensional gene coding, so a plan was devised to allow the souls waiting within the Sphere of Amenti in D-4 to be re-entered into Earth by a process called Down-grading. Through this process the vibrational essence of the race morphogenetic field could be \u201cstepped down\u201d to a slower vibrational pattern, by passing a portion of the morphogenetic field through the core of another planet in HU-1. This experiment would require the use of a plane- tary body within the same time spiral cycles as Earth, which had a core vibra- tional speed/particle pulsation rate slightly higher than that of Earth. The planet chosen for this experiment is in your Sirius star system and is known as Sirius B. An artificial portal bridge was constructed between the core of Sirius B, the Sphere of Amenti",
