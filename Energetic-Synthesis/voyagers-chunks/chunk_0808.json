The Blue Flame would then send a corresponding spark of fifth-dimensional frequency back into the Earth's core, which would open the Earth's morphogenetic field to accept the Sphere of Amenti, while raising the Earth's grid speed high enough to hold the D-5 Blue Flame morphogenetic field of Tara. Upon the second spark, the Sphere of Amenti would begin its descent through the Arc of the Covenant, while the Blue Flame remained within the Andromeda planet. Originally, the descent of the Sphere of Amenti was to take about 2,000 years, its energies becoming progressively more available to the peoples of Earth, stimulating the assembly of the fifth DNA strand and the raising of consciousness. During its 2,000-year descent, the Earth grid speed would rise in increments, allowing the Earth's energy system to adjust to the increasing infusion of high-frequency energy. Once the Sphere was re- positioned within the Earth core, there would be a period of several years for the Earth grid to assimilate the new frequency, and the race memory would progressively infuse the Earth grid. As the race memory from the Amenti morphogenetic field filtered through the Earth grid, this energy would stimu- late the DNA of everyone on the planet, and the lost memory would reenter the cellular memory of individuals as their DNA strands began t",
