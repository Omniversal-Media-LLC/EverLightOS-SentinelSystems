  "text": "6 Ascension Mechanics HUMANITY\u2019S EVOLUTION The Science of Ascension, Time Cycles, Morphogenetic Waves and the Sphere of Amenti As we have mentioned before, ascension is not some lofty spiritual con- cept designed by the minds of man, it is the literal, tangible scienti fic process of the evolution of consciousness and biology within the laws of energy mechanics that apply to a multidimensional reality system. You can go about your human lives, with your consciousness confined to the limitations pres- ently imposed by your physical body, or you can learn the mechanics by which those limitations can be released, and begin to experience the reality of freedom that is the comprehension of yourself-as-soul. Whether or not you view ascension and multidimensional evolution as a reality while you are alive on Earth, you will be directly faced with that reality once your consciousness has passed out of physical life and into the multidimensional framework. At the death of the physical body you will discover that your consciousness lives on and your evolution continues. How well you prepare for that discovery now will determine the ease with which you are able to take your next evolutionary step once you \u201cwake up on the other side.\u201d All souls will eventually evolve and ascend through the 15-dimensional scale, to re-emerge as sentient iden- tity within realms of pure consciousness beyond",
