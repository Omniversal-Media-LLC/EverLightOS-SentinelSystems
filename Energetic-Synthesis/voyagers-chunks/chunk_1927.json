The knowledge that Earth and the human race would face something monumental during the \u201cend times\u201d has been the com- prehension of visionaries throughout the course of recorded history. The \u201cend times\u201d represent the point in Earth\u2019s evolution when the planet has com- pleted a cycle of 26,556 years and moves forward through its ascension period to begin a new cycle. Our upcoming \u201cend times\u201d hold a promise not present during the end times of past 26,566-year cycles, for this is the first time the planetary grid will vibrate high enough to allow planetary dimensional ascension to take place. This opportunity has not been available on Earth for over 200,000 years. The Bridge Zone Project is made possible precisely because Earth is approaching the end of its present time cycle. If it were not for the Bridge Zone Project, Earth would once again be unable to fulfill the promise of ascension, as without guardian intervention Earth\u2019s grid would not have reached the necessary level of vibration. The planet would have remained within the HU-1 dimensions for another 26,566-year cycle. The new cycle would have reached an early close with the destruction of Earth before the next ascension period occurred. 461",
