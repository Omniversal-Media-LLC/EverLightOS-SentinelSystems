  "text": "The Three Christs Hibiru Cloisters. The descendants of these groups presently carry the full 12- strand DNA package within their gene codes, as this group was one of those chosen in 1972 AD to receive full-genetic realignment through interaction with the time traveling, hybrid Zionite race (see V oyagers I, p.38). The Zion- ites were created during the present-day Zeta infiltration and were sent back in time to realign certain ancestral groups with the 12-strand DNA imprint, in order to accelerate the evolution of present-day humans. The followers and descendants of the Jesheua-12 Essenes were one of the groups chosen for this realignment. Groups involved with Zionite genetic restructuring are consid- ered to be of Celestial Human lineage as they carry the full 12-strand DNA Silicate Matrix within their operational genetic codes, regardless of their pri- mary racial line. (The Silicate Matrix appears within family lines as a recessive gene composite, which remains dormant until it is called into activation via opening of chakra centers 8-15.) Various groups within Root Races 3-5 and Cloister races 3-6, along with several other hybrid race strains, were chosen for this genetic realignment, so the Silicate Matrix is distributed at random throughout present-day human genetic lines. The greatest concentrations can be found within the Hebrew, Melchizedek, Aryan, East Indian and Tibe",
