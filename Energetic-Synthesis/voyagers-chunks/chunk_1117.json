In the Bridge Zone Project we are going to shift Earth entirely out of its present D-3 time cycle, which con- stitutes accelerating the pulsation rate of particles and shifting the angular rotation of particle spin by 22.5\u00b0. In order to make this shift successfully, 8% of Earth\u2019s populations have to fully assemble the fifth DNA strand, 144,000 individuals must assemble the sixth DNA strand and the remaining popula- tions must rapidly reach an accretion level of 4.5, which is the assembly of all of the fourth DNA strand and half of the fifth strand. Remember that consciousness will perceive as solid the dimensional fre- quency bands one dimension below its present station of focus. For the con- sciousness of humanity to experience the physicality of Earth at the 3.5- accretion level of the Bridge Zone, that consciousness must have a minimum of 4.5-accretion, which comes with assembly of all of the fourth DNA strand and half of the fifth strand. The human collective represents part of the Earth\u2019s matter body, and if the collective accretion level of human beings remains at its present 3\u20143.5 average, the accretion level and vibration rate of the Earth\u2019s",
