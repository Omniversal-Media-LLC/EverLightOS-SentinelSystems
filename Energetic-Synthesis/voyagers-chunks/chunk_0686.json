The six portals from the Sphere of Amenti (the original one to Tara\u2019s past and five new ones into various stages of Earth\u2019s future) linked Tara\u2019 s past, through various time periods on Earth, into Tara\u2019 s future, creating a new track in time through which Earth could re-evolve into the \ufb01fth-dimensional frequency bands and merge with Tara . Once this merger was accomplished Earth would become Tara, new lands would open up within and emerge upon Earth, and Tara would reclaim the energetic thrust lost in the fall so evolution into the seventh-dimensional Gaia could continue. The six portals in the Sphere of Amenti also allowed the five Cloistered races to incarnate into dimensional bands/time fields 2 through 6, pulling into their consciousness and body forms the fragmented consciousness of the lost souls from each of those dimensional bands. The time codes (frequency pat- terns) from the first dimensional strand of DNA that had been built up through Root Races one and two would link into the frequencies of dimensions 2 through 6. The consciousness within the Sphere of Amenti would leave the morphogenetic field and express into manifestation as Root Races within each of those dimensional bands, building up into the DNA pattern strands 2 through 6.
