A planet evolves out of one Harmonic Universe and into the next as each level of its three-dimensional body simultaneously com- pletes pulling the frequency patterns of its respective dimension into the planet\u2019s morphogenetic field. These processes give the consciousness perceiv- ing the third dimension the illusion of passage through linear time. In actual- ity, time is not linear, but simultaneous. Time exists as a Uni\ufb01ed Field of particles pulsating at various rhythms and spinning on various angles of rotation, through which the illusions of manifest space and linear time appear to individuated identities, as they bring segments of the Uni- \ufb01ed Field of particle substance into view by moving their consciousness through por- 147",
