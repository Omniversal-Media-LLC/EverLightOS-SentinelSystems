All humans can reverse-mutate dna template distortions and bring dormant DNA template potentials into activation through self- generated DNA bio-regenesis technologies, through which the 12-strand DNA angelic human potential can be progressively restored and reactivated within the operational DNA. This is precisely what visiting Fallen Angelic Legions do not want contemporary humanity to accomplish. The Annu-Elohim, Anunnaki and Drakonian-Seraphim Fallen Angelic Races possess a digressive maximum of 11 and 10 Strand DNA Template potential respectively. As the Fallen Angelic Legions cannot embody the 12th-dimensional frequencies of the Maharata \u201cChristiac Current\u201d due to absence of the 12th DNA Strand Template; they carry what is considered to be the \u201cAnti-Christiac\u201d or \u201cAnti-Christ\u201d genetic code. The \u201cAnti-Christ genetic code\u201d can be restored to its original \u201cChristiac\u201d capacity through DNA Bio-Regenesis, IF the Fallen Angelic Races choose to do so. Fallen Angelic race founders from Density-4, dimensions 10 and 11, intentionally choose to retain their \u201cAnti- christiac\u201d genetic code and that of their manifest races. If the full 12th Strand DNA Template were regenerated within the biological Fallen",
