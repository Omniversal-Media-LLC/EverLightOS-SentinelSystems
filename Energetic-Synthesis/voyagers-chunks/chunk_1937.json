Earth and the human populations are now approaching a series of Stellar Activations, as part of Earth\u2019s natural 26,556-year Euiago cycle. The auric field of the planet and those of Earth\u2019s populations will undergo transformation between 2000 AD-2017 AD. In order for humans to achieve ascension to the Bridge Zone Earth and avoid becoming trapped in the D-3 time cycle, a minimum of one and one half personal Stellar Activations must take place. Earth will experi- ence six such activations between 2000-2017. Humans who do not prepare the body, consciousness and chakra system for these activations will be unable to shift into the Bridge Zone time contin- uum or ascend to Tara and beyond.
