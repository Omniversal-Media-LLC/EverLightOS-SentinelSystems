When used in other ways, the HD-Cs of the ''Dove'' receive, amplify and transmit invisible sub-sonic wave fields from the Pylon Selenite Rod transmission bases in the Planetary Shields of Phantom Arcturus. The Seven Pylon Selenite Rods stationed on Phantom Arcturus are the ''relay station'' or ''midway station'' through which the frequencies of similar Pylon Selenite Rod installations on Sirius A and in Trapezium Orion and the Hourglass Nebula in Sagittarius interface with the living Time Matrix system. The HD-C points in Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields can be used as Sub- sonic ULF Scalar Pulse transmitters that are capable of sending Targeted Sub-sonic Scalar Pulses through the Dove Matrix network grid lines of Earth, to very precise targets . Like the Falcon and the Phoenix, the Dove Matrix is a powerful weapons system, especially when combined with the 418",
