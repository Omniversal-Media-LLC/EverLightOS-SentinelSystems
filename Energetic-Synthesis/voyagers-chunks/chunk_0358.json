Those who are not selected are intended to be removed through dramas created by holographic inserts, such as the \u201cChrist\u201d drama example we used in the previous section. The Zeta have other plans in mind for the Starseeds. The Silicate Matrix within the Starseed genetic imprint is valuable to the Zeta. It is this element for which they search during unauthorized (by the Soul Matrix) abductions, for they hope to create a stronger more versatile hybrid through humans carrying this code. They view the Starseeds as the potential breeders of a three-dimensional Earth hybrid race that they hope will repopulate the planet once the clearing is completed. The unenlightened Zeta also fear the Starseeds, as they possess the potential ability of seeing through the holographic inserts. The Starseeds also are able to more easily partake of multidimensional communication, which enables them to \u201cgo above the frequency fence\u201d the Zeta are working now to \u201cerect\u201d within the human DNA code (remember, the frequency fence is a type of sound technology that utilizes contrived frequency modulation). Because the Starseed is already re-linked, to some degree, to its original Soul Matrix the Zeta cannot perform a forced matrix transplant upon a Starseed without first dismantling the Soul Matrix. This is very difficult to do with the technology they have available. And",
