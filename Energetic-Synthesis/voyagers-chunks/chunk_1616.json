If the Trion Field is successfully created before 2003, a ''frequency blanke'' called a Meajh\u00e9 Field, can be constructed within Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and outer atmosphere , which will buffer Earth from many effects of these accelerated frequency infusions. The Meajh\u00e9 Field, created through a temporary merging of Earth\u2019s Planetary Merkaba Field and that of the Meajh\u00e9 Zone Time Matrix, can absorb much of the excessive frequency that will otherwise bombard Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields and collapse Earth\u2019s magnetic fields and atmosphere during the Three-Day Particle Conversion period. In the Labor Day 2001 workshop most of us were deeply sobered by the GA/Eieyani\u2019s technical physics answer to the question of \u201cWhat will Earth life experience during this accelerated phase before the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period?\u201d This information is too lengthy for inclusion in this book; I will simply say that if the Meajh\u00e9 Field is not created \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t _____________________________ 8.
