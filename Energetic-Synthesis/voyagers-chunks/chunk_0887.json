Healing of the Egotistical mind would require its integration with the Higher Self mind, through which its power and place within the universe could be under- stood. The Higher Self mind could not only perceive in the highest frequency bands of the third dimension, it could also \u201cplug into\u201d the D-4 astral identity and the soul matrix identity that is contained within the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-dimensional frequency patterns of the Amenti morphogenetic field. The Higher Self allowed the fourth and fifth DNA strands to begin manifest- ing, if those strand imprints were contained within the race DNA imprint. As long as the Frequency Fence was operational the Ego could not translate higher dimensional data into conscious awareness, nor could it translate the comprehension of the Higher Self mind. But the elemental aspects of the human body, the portions of consciousness manifesting through the second DNA strand that are focused within the second-dimensional frequency fields, could translate portions of the Higher Self cognition, as the 10th-12th over- tones of DNA strand two could translate some of the electrical impulses from the 10th-l2th overtones of DNA strand 3.
