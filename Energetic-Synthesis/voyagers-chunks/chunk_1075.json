  "text": "Current Events TIME-CYCLE MECHANICS AND EVOLUTION Time-Cycle Mechanics In order to understand the dynamics involved in such a time continuum shift, it is helpful to realize that the structure and illusion of linear time is cre- ated through the pulsation rate of particles and their relationship to that of other particles. Each of the six 4,426 year smaller cycles within one 26,556 year Harmonic Time Cycle represents one time continuum. A 26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle, through which a planet evolves through the 3-dimen- sional bands of one Harmonic Universe, is called an Euiago. A planet passes through each of the six smaller time continua as it progresses upward through the 3-dimensional scale within its Harmonic Universe. Each dimensional band contains two time continua of 4,426 years each, so each dimension rep- resents a time track of 8,852 years. Of the six time continua in a 26,556-year Euiago cycle, four time con- tinua represent forward-moving tracks of time called Pardo, and two repre- sent counter-rotating tracks of time called Reiago, in which the planet passes through the parallel universe. A Pardo = 17,704 years (4 continua of 4,426 years each = 4 x 4,426 years = 17,704 years). A Reiago = 8,852 years (2 con- tinua of 4,426 years each = 2 x 4,426 = 8,852 years) spent in the parallel uni- verse. Each Euiago contains one Pardo and one Reiago. A planet\u2019s progression t",
