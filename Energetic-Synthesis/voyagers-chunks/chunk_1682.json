The \u201cFalcon Phi-Ex PIN \u201d connecting to the Zeta-Rigelian Drakonian \u201cFalcon wormhole,\u201d is also one of these ancient Atlantian PIN Control Grids, as are numerous others soon to be discussed. These Atlantian Pylon Implant Network (APIN) systems were in active use as tools of territorial dominion by various competing Fallen Angelic/Intruder ET factions throughout the Atlantian period. APIN systems differ in the type of Planetary Shield implanting that is used, but all implanting utilizes sophisticated crystal-based technologies similar to the silicon-based microchips used in conventional computer technologies. The APIN systems can be compared to massive global grid systems made of strategically placed ''crystalline microchips'' that interface directly with the natural, multidimensional, electromagnetic energy conduits of Star Gates, Axiatonal and Ley Line systems organic to Earth\u2019s Templar. APIN technology is not intrinsically a \u201cnegative\u201d technology, but rather an environmentally valid application of the natural spiritual and scientific laws of Creation Physics. Before these technologies fell into the hands of Fallen Angelic races, they were used openly by various Guardian races in many universal systems to facilitate and enhance the experience of evolution and ascensio",
