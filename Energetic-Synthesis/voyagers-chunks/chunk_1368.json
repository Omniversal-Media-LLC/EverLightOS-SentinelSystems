As a strategic move to ensure the success of the One World Order Earth dominion agenda held by each of the competing Fallen Angelic groups, the Necromiton race of Density-3 Andromeda, the \u201cbeloved Andromies\u201d who have been in contact with several prominent people in the UFO Move- ment, opened negotiations between the competing Fallen Angelic collec- tives, successfully bringing most of them together to take a united stance against the Emerald Covenant peace treaty and freedom agenda. On Septem- ber 12, 2000 the GA was given the ultimatum that 50,000 of its Grail Line Indigo Children could be evacuated out, then the rest of human populations were to be left to the agenda of the UIR.
