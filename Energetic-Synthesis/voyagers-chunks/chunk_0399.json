  "text": "le you really know about the nature of your identity, the workings of your body and the purpose for your existence. Before you discredit the practices that will allow your logical mind to grow, find humility, and realize that you have much to learn. Allow your \u201cfrog\u201d of logic to leap beyond the confines of its bowl. Let your contemporaries, who have already passed through the maze of limiting ideas, guide you gently into your own healing through expanding your ideas. Try some of the new mind technologies that are available to you now, and ask the soul matrix to guide you. You can heal, and through the private healing of each individual will come the healing of the species. You have been programmed, by those who wish to see you fail in the fulfillment of your evolution, to remain in darkness, living in a world of duality in which you are always at the mercy of subconscious forces. They would like to see you remain fearful, frightened by the chaotic energy you can feel within you, and of a seemingly chaotic universe within which you reside. Do not allow them to win! You have the power within you to succeed beyond your wildest dreams, to experience realities free from the disease, sorrow and confusion that your polarized perceptions create. So much wonder awaits you as you awaken to the truth of your heritage and take your rightful place within",
