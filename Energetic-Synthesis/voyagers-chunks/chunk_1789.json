Oh brother. . .here we go! Under natural environmental conditions, dormant portions of the DNA templates of biological life-forms spontaneously and progressively activate in reaction to the frequencies of Stellar Wave Infusions that occur during SACs. This natural DNA function allows the physical, emotional and mental body structures to create temporary adaptability to the increased UHF of SACs, preventing illness and premature death. The DNA template responds to the planetary electrical and magnetic fields, and certain kinds of \u201cdisruptions\u201d in the magnetic balances of Earth\u2019s outer atmosphere block the natural DNA-activation process. Temporary Scalar- pulse disruption of Earth\u2019s outer atmosphere is precisely the method used by Galactic Federation in 3470 BC, on behalf of the Nibiruian Council, to further \u201cerase\u201d our then-re-surfacing Atlantian race memory and to further scramble our DNA templates and language patterns.
