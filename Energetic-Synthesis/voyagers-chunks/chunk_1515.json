Advanced study of Masters Sacred Physics Mechanics is required be- fore the full body of knowledge contained within the Book of Maps and Keys can be sufficiently understood and functionally utilized. \u2022 Due to the progressive difficulties emerging in Earth\u2019s 2000-2017 Stellar Ac- tivations Cycle (SAC), there is presently no time available to methodi- cally initiate advanced study of Masters Sacred Physics Mechanics; such study will be made available to the public if Earth\u2019s 2000-2017 Planetary Christos Alignment is successful. If the 2000-2017 ''Bridge Zone Project'' (see page 142) and its inherent Planetary Christos Realignment Mission (see Chapter 12) are not successful, pole shift before 2017 will be un- avoidable; in this event, the Founders\u2019 first priority will be evacuation, followed by education.
