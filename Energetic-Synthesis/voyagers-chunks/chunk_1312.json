Humans who do not organically carry the imprint for the fifth and sixth DNA strands will find that the portions of these strands that had begun assembly and activation during the infusion acceleration, but which had not yet fully assembled, will begin rapid deac- tivation and disassembly, once the Earth grid infusions have ceased. Popu- lations in the Bridge Zone, who have not assembled and activated the fifth DNA strand, will return to a 4.5-strand assembly level (4.5 accretion), and populations on Phantom Earth will return to 3.5-strand DNA assem- bly (3.5 accretion). The DNA will return to its natural accretion level and evolution of DNA will return to its slow and methodical process. On Bridge Zone Earth, the Halls of Amenti will close to the masses that did not com- plete fifth DNA strand assembly. Passage through the Halls of Amenti requires a fifth DNA strand activation level. As long as the Sphere of Amenti remains unsealed within Bridge Zone Earth\u2019s Morphogenetic Field, the Halls of Amenti will remain open to anyone in the Bridge Zone who can assemble the fifth strand, but fifth strand assembly may now take several incarnations. The Hall of Records remains open in the Bridge Zone, as long as Earth\u2019s g",
