The slowest vibrating particles break apart their form construction and re-appear as part of the Earth\u2019s particle-base in the past, at a time period in the beginning of the present 26,556-year cycle. The particles pulsating at a middle range rate of speed enter the faster time cycle of D-4 for five years, then return to their original time cycle in HU-1 to complete the remaining 2213 years of the ascension cycle. The mid-range vibration particles appear within the present time continuum in the parallel anti-particle universe (which is the same time continuum as the D-4 cycle in the particle universe), then after five years return to their original present D- 3 HU-1 time continuum. What this process constitutes in terms of the human perspective, is the opening up of three tracks of time, or three time continua, during the 10-year period surrounding the half-point within the second ascension cycle. Human beings and their consciousness are made up of energy particles. As Earth under- goes this particle separation, transmutation and dimensional transfer, the ener- getic structures of human biology and consciousness also undergo this transformation via the makeup of their particle content. Humans possessing the slowest vibration rates would find their consciousness fr",
