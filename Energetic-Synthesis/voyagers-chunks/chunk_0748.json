Members of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, who specialize in dimensional ascension training are not neces- sarily direct members of the Melchizedek/Melchazedek race line, but often work under the teaching programs of that Cloister.

This area is known as the Inner Earth, and large civilizations exist in these lands since times prior to Atlantis, when the Melchizedeks and others began to retreat from surface life. These underground civilizations exist to this day, and occasionally members interact with surface Earth through the hidden caverns that link Earth\u2019s surface to the modulation zone of the Inner Earth. Both Cloister Family Melchizedeks and Templar-Melchizedeks reside within these lands, under the primary guard- ianship of the Speakers of the Blue Flame and Melchizedek Priesthood, and Priesthoods of Ur and Mu from Tara.
