The \u201couter space\" existing beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere repre- sents a Repulsion Zone and the frequency fields of D-4 through 15 that exist beyond this Repulsion Zone. From the fourth-dimensional perspective, there appears to be a separation of many miles between Earth and the Sun because the natural Repulsion Zone between D-3 and D-4 creates the illusion of absence of light and expansion of space. This Repulsion Zone is created by the 45\u00b0 shift of angular rotation of particle spin that occurs between one Har- monic Universe and the Harmonic Universe above. There are five primary Repulsion Zones within the 15-dimensional universe, which create the illu- sion of vast distances between star systems existing within the 15 dimensions. Though Earth, the planets and the galaxies appear to be separated in space by great distances, that distance is only a natural holographic illusion created by the refraction of energy waves through varying angular relation- ships between spinning particles. All that you perceive outside of yourselves, including Earth and what appears to lie beyond, in Earth\u2019s immediate solar system, actually exists at the center of Earth\u2019s Sun, at varyi",
