Bring the Symbol into focus in your mind as soon as you are able. Once you see the Symbol, clearly give the command \u201cMonitor Retrieve.\u201d Repeat the command several times in your mind then focus your attention on your breathing rhythm. With each inhale imagine that you can feel the energy of the dream material pulling up from the depths of the dream world, collecting within the center of the Symbol. Continue to \u201cbreathe\u201d the energy up into the Symbol for as long as you feel the stream of energy flowing. You will reach a point when you feel this stream of energy depleting, growing fainter, until you can no longer feel the movement of this stream of energy. (It may take a few sessions before you can sense the beginning of this stream of energy, but it will be there.) When you sense the end of the energy stream take 3 more natural breaths as the energy \u201csettles\u201d into the Symbol Code. Your Symbol Code is now \u201cloaded\u201d with electrically encoded data from the other Components of Mind as derived through the dream state.",
