Each of the four Time Cycles in which the Angelic Human races were seeded represents an evolution- ary Race Cycle or an \u201cEvolutionary Round\u201d in the \u201cCycle of the Rounds\u201d Angelic Human Evolutionary Blueprint. \u2022 Each of the four Rounds in the Angelic Human \u201cCycle of the Rounds\u201d is commissioned to \u201cAnchor\u201d a specific set of interdimensional frequencies into Earth\u2019s scalar-standing-wave Manifestation Template, Earth\u2019s Plane- tary Shields, within each of the specific Time Cycles in which the Angelic Human Evolutionary \u201cRound Cycles\u201d are placed. Each Evolutionary Round is intended to serve a part in fulfilling humanity\u2019s Divine Commis- sion, the Sacred Mission of Planetary Guardianship for which Angelic Humans were seeded on Earth. FIRE LETTER SEQUENCES \u2022 The Angelic Human and Maji Cloister Races of each Evolutionary Round anchor frequency into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields through the scalar-stand- ing-wave structures that are an inherent part of the personal DNA Tem- plate Core. The DNA Templates of the Angelic Human Races within each Evolutionary Round Cycle are built upon specific scalar-standing wave Light-Sound patterns called Fire Let",
