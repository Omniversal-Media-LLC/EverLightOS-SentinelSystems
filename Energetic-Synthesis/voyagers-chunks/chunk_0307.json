They were able to close the mediation zone effectively, and when they observed the area where the hole had been the hole was no longer there. The Zeta assumed that they had closed the hole when they closed the mediation zone territories in which it had existed. This was not the case. The mediation zone had been created by merging certain frequency patterns of the third- dimensional and other dimensional versions of their planet. The frequency patterns of each were \u201cbent\u201d slightly until they came into range of each other. Then an artificial \u201cfrequency splice\u201d was added to serve as a bridge between the two frequency bands. This bridge forced open an existing dimensional portal and kept it open as long as the bridge was in place (this is a manipulation process that goes against universal law, as it throws the entire time cycle of which it is a part out of synchronization with the Time Matrix). The black hole was still encoded within the frequency patterns of both dimensions, and when the bridge was closed the hole pattern fragmented, changing location within the outer atmosphere of both planets. Again it took generations to rediscover the continued existence and new location of the hole, and by this time the genetic mutations that this project had initiated began to",
