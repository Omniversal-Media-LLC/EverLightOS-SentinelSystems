  "text": "Morphogenetic Crystal Seals control the angle at which the Dimensional and Harmonic Merkaba Fields will rotate, thus they direct the angular rotation of particle spin between the dimensional bands of a forms particle construction. The Star Crystal Seals control the operation of the Seed Crystal Seals in each dimension and can release the Seed Crystal Seals, allowing the dimensionally separated portions of the morphogenetic field to merge with each other. The D-2 Orange-Gold Flame of Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field, the D-5 Blue Flame of Tara\u2019s morphogenetic field and the D-7 Violet Flame of Gaia\u2019s mor- phogenetic field, which we have previously discussed, represent three of the 15 planetary Morphogenetic Seed Crystal Seals which connect the planet to its 15-dimensional morphogenetic field. Earth-Tara-Gaia also has 15 Planetary Star Crystal Seals, which exist within various locations throughout the 15- dimensional universe, that keep the dimensional planetary particle fields sepa- rate and regulate the angle of rotation of the planetary Dimensional Merkaba Fields. Planetary Star Crystal Seals regulate the evolution of planets and stars over extensive periods of time, through directing the orbital patterns of planets, stars and galaxies. The upcoming ascension period is possible precisely because of the natural function of the Planetary and Galactic Star Crystal Seals. The Planetary",
