First of all, the hypothesis that non-earthly environments supportive of evolved biological life have not been identified is built upon the assumptions that all forms of evolved biological life require the same environmental conditions and that science has identified all possible forms of evolved biological life. The fact is, there may be types of highly evolved non-carbon based biological life forms (such as silica-based biology) of which science is unaware and other types of biology may require other types of environmental conditions. Planets assumed to be uninhabitable could actually support subterranean, surface or etheric civilizations of evolved life forms that are not yet known to exist. Secondly and of most importance, the hypothesis that evidence of past or present civilizations has not been found on other planets is built upon two unlikely assumptions: All planets and galaxies in the universe can be perceived, located and identified through modern technological instrumentation. The existence of all possible worlds can be theorized through contemporary mathematical computation. Our scientists have not yet seriously considered the possibility that inhabited Otherworlds may not only exist on other planets in other star systems, but that they may also reside within other-dimensional",
