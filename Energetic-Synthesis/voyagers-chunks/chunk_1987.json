The coming ascension period of 2012-2017 offers humanity a rare opportunity to rapidly reverse-mutate these genetic distortions, realign the DNA imprint with its original 12-strand pattern and accelerate the evolution of biology and consciousness by thousands of years. Humans who do not make the shift to Bridge Zone Earth will not have this opportunity again, for the Stellar Merkaba Spirals do not fully align with the Merkaba Fields of a Descending planet. The DNA of humans on the Descending Phantom Earth will undergo another mutation; the DNA will be unable to assemble beyond the third strand and portions of the fourth strand that had begun to assemble will dismantle and de-activate. This genetic mutation can be remedied only through a Host Matrix Transplant, through which a Soul Matrix from HU-2 allows the HU-1 incarnate to energetically and genetically braid into its Soul Matrix morphogenetic field. Individuals of Phantom Earth who do not have Host Matrix Transplants will find their genetic codes, bodies and conscious- ness deteriorating over several generations until the ability to reproduce is lost. Cloning tactics further reduce the genetic imprint and ultimately will not preserve the species. This is precisely the c",
