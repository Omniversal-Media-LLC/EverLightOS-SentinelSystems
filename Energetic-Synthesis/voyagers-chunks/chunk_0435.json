If you had a greater understanding of universal physics and the operational cycles and dynamics of the time and dimensional portal systems, those questions would be statements, for you would understand the greater evolution of which your species and Earth are a part. Consider this question for a moment: if this was a true depiction of the circumstances upon your planet, which probable version of Earth would you be aligned with?
