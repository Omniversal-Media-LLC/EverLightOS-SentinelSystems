If they began broadcasting too soon, the Guard- ians\u2019 infusions of D-4 frequency would counteract their EM transmissions, and the genetic mutation would not \u201chold\u201d within the DNA. The Dracos-Zeta Resistance decided upon the year 2004 as their target date. In order to fulfill their plan of covert mass infiltration, they would have to enter their \ufb02eets into Earth\u2019s D-2 frequency bands during the peak of Earth\u2019s D-1/D-4 Merkaba Field cycle, which takes place every 20 years on August 12th. Dimensional Merkaba Fields go through cycles of movement in which the two spiraling energy fields vertically condense and draw toward each other, then progressively expand on the vertical axis, drawing away from each other. When the Merkaba Fields draw away from each other, the upright electrical spiral moves into the magnetic Merkaba spiral of the dimension above, which causes a temporary blending of frequencies between the mag- netic spiral of one dimension and that of the dimension above. These points of interdimensional magnetic spiral blending are called Dimensional Mag- netic Peaks. During Magnetic Peaks, natural interdimensional portal win- dows briefly open, allowing unencumbered transit between dimensional bands. Magnetic Peaks also occur between the Merkaba Spir",
