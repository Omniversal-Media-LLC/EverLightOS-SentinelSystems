All that you perceive outside of yourselves, including Earth and what appears to lie beyond, in Earth\u2019s immediate solar system, actually exists at the center of Earth\u2019s Sun, at varying rates of particle pulsation and angular relationship of particle spin. Earth\u2019s Sun is likewise contained within a larger solar structure with other planetary bodies, which would appear to exist outside of that Sun from various stations of perception. The reality of the mechanics of energy is that dimensions 1\u2014 3, and all things contained within them, exist within the D-4 Merkaba Fields of Tara\u2019s gold core crystal and that core crystal is stationed at the center of the Sun. The gold core crystal at the center of Earth\u2019s Sun serves as an electromagnetic por- tal structure between HU-1 and HU-2. Though the Universe appears spread out over great distances, in reality it all exists within the same space, at vari- ous dimensional frequency levels and particle spin relationships. We are telling you of these hidden reality mechanics so you may begin to comprehend what will be taking place on Earth as your half-cycle period approaches and the Bridge Zone Project goes into operation. We have said that Earth\u2019s accretion level will be shifted from its present 2.5 level to that of 3.5 accretion. The present 2.5-accretion level is the measurem",
