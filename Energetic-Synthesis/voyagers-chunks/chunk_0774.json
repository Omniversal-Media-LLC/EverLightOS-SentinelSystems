  "text": "Science of Ascension within cycles of time designated by the dimensional bands in which they appear. At certain points in these dimensional time cycles the frequency bands of one dimension blend into the one above and below, which allows matter and anti-matter particles to merge, transmute and re-manifest within the dimensional bands above and below. The particles and anti-particles that will be able to shift upward, out of their home dimensional band, are those that have fully assembled the frequency patterns within their home dimen- sion. During this point in a time cycle the energetic tapestry, or grid, of the matter-particle planet passes through the grid of its anti-particle double from the parallel universe, and through this energy fusion certain portions of those energetic grids transmute, sending a Morphogenetic Wave into the dimen- sional band above. The morphogenetic wave then projects its particle and anti-particle form into manifestation within the new dimension and its inherent time cycle. The portions of the particles and anti-particles that had not fully assembled all of the frequency patterns from their home dimension will not be able to merge, and will thus manifest from the morphogenetic field back into their home dimension to continue their evolution through assembling the remaining frequency bands of that dimension. The morphogenetic field of a person exists",
