We call the point of evolution when the full DNA strand is assembled the Consummation and the point when the consciousness transfers into the first sub-frequency band of the next dimension up the Initiation. With the Consummation of one DNA strand, and the Initiation of the next strand, the contents of the consummated strand begin to progressively appear in physical manifestation for the consciousness, now focused in the dimension above. We call the point where the contents of a DNA strand begin to physically appear within the perceptual range of the conscious per- sonality the Activation of the strand. For example, when the consciousness has moved through the entire 12 sub-frequency bands of D-3 and thus assembled the third DNA strand, the identity is considered to be at its third Consummation, (the morphogenetic field and consciousness have \u201cconsumed\u201d, or drawn into themselves, the fre- quency patterns of the third dimension). At the third Consummation, the fourth Initiation begins, as the station of consciousness transfers to the first D-4 sub-frequency bands and the D-4 frequencies begin to enter the morpho- genetic field and the DNA. As the first sub-frequency band of D-4 initiates into the morphogenetic field, the first sub-frequency band in the D-3 third DNA strand begins to Activate, or holographically project its contents into the range of",
