Fallen Angelic races of the Phantom Matrix cannot utilize full-spectrum D-12 frequency or higher\u2014their biology and technologies are limited to D- 10 to D-11.5 transmission/reception capacity. The D-12 Hydroplasmic ''Christos'' Maharata frequency and Trion Field Primal Creation Currents will naturally override any Phantom Matrix distortions within Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields and biological DNA, if D-12 frequency reaches a critical mass charge in Earth\u2019s Templar. Currently, the UIR has realized that it is now ''in a race for time,'' Their originally intended 2003-2004 ''Dimensional Blend Experiment'' (see page 386) and ''Frequency Fence'' 2 will not occur if D-12 frequency reaches Critical Mass in Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields before 2003. Critical Mass 12-Code Pulse will be achieved in 2002 if people continue to assist Emerald Covenant races in Rainbow Roundtables (RRTs) to activate the Four Faces of Man LPIN and build the Trion/ Meajh\u00e9 Field and if the Mass Human DNA Awakening continues. The Checkerboard Matrix DNA Mutation that reversed the Security Code sequences in Human DNA and Merkaba Field was carefully orchestrated by the Annunaki Invasion force since 25,500 BC, and painstakingly nurtured since the 9558 BC fall of Atlantis.''
