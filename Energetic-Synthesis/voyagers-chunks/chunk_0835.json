The original pyramid was designed as a Harmonic Resonance Chamber, through which multidimensional frequency bands could be pulled in from deep space and from the planetary core of Sirius B, using a great ankh positioned directly below a crystalline cap stone. Through the power of the ankh a tre- mendous amount of UHF energy was pulled into focus within the cap stone of the pyramid, then projected downward through the structure into the second- dimensional frequency bands. The pyramid and Arc of the Covenant were situated upon Earth's geographical center point, within the energy vortex that represented the \u201cHeart Chakra\" within Earth's planetary bio-energetic system. This vortex allowed energy exchange to take place between Earth and the fourth-dimensional fre- quency bands. By creating a Harmonic Resonance Chamber within such an interdimensional vortex, the D-2 overtones of HU-1 could be combined with the base tones of D-4/HU-2, forming an interdimensional resonant tone through which visiting craft traveling from Sirius B and other star systems could enter and leap through time, making transit to Earth almost instanta- neous. The Great Pyramid was created to allow immediate intervention of the Sir",
