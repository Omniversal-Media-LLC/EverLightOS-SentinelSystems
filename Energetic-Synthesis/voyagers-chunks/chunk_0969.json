Once this higher-dimensional frequency reaches a certain peak concentration within the Earth\u2019s grid, the race morphogenetic field/Sphere of Amenti opens into the Earth\u2019s core morphogenetic field, and the individual race morphogenetic fields open into the Sphere of Amenti collective. At this point within the energy mechanics, the Earth\u2019s grid begins transmitting fifth-dimensional fre- quency directly into the bio-energetic fields of everyone on the planet. This infusion of fifth-dimensional frequency then sets the energetic imprint for the fifth DNA strand within all of the races, even those whose personal, organic morphogenetic imprint did not originally contain the fifth DNA strand. Because of the races with the larger gene-code packages, the entire species has the opportunity to rapidly evolve this larger DNA imprint and to trans- mute the limitations of the genetic codes with which they were born. The ability to fully transmute the personal genetic imprint is not always available on Earth. It is dependent upon whether or not enough of the larger gene-code races are present on the Earth, which is dependent upon whether or not the Earth\u2019s energetic grid vibrates high enough to sustain a concentra- tion of beings with higher frequency genetic codes.
