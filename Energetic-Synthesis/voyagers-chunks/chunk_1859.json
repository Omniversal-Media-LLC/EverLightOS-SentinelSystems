Manual resetting of the natural 12-Code-Pulse \u201cDivine D-12 Pre-matter Blueprint\u201d in Earth\u2019s ALL system is accomplished through running D-12 frequency\u00b9 into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields via RRTs conducted at specific times and locations. When an Organic Seal releases, it takes anywhere from three to 12 months for its frequencies to spread through, and reach critical mass within, the corresponding ALL network. As the Jehovian Seals\u2019 chaotic frequencies \u201cride on\u201d the Organic Seal current, the effects of Jehovian Seal \u201copening\u201d also emerge and reach critical mass between three and 12 months after the Jehovian Seal has released. If the Jehovian Seals release and are not realigned to a 12-Code-Pulse before reaching critical mass, climatic and/or tectonic disturbances will erupt within the geographical regions corresponding to the Jehovian Seal\u2019s placement. just as is the case with Earth\u2019s 12 Organic Star ___________________ 1. \u201cMaharata Current\u201d 428",
