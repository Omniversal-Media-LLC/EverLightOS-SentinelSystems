Once all of the frequencies of a Stellar Spiral have fully entered Earth's morphogenetic field, the next dimensional Stellar Spiral begins alignment with Earth and the next Stellar Wave Infusion begins. When half of the frequencies of the new Stellar Spiral have entered Earth\u2019s morphogenetic field, all of the frequencies from the previous Stellar Spiral complete activating/transmitting through Earth\u2019s grid, the previous Stellar Activation ends and the next Activation begins. Halfway through the next Activation, the previous Wave Infusion ends and the next Wave Infu- sion begins. The process of Stellar Activations and Stellar Wave Infusions represents a complex, multidimensional synchronization of Stellar Spiral movement. It is not necessary to comprehend the complexities of this pro- cess, but at this time it is important for you to know the basic mechanics of Stellar Spiral alignment, as you will be faced with these conditions between 5/5/2000 and 2017. Earth will experience six Stellar Activations and Wave Infusions, which will alter the pulsation speed of Earth\u2019s three-dimensional particle base, as progressively higher frequencies are transmitted through Earth\u2019s grid. If Earth\u2019s core had not been raised to a high enough particle pulsation rhythm, via the Guardians D-4 frequ",
