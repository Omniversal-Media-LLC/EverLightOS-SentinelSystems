Seven massive Crystal Pylon Selenite Rods were placed within the Arcturian SG-7 control grid, before the SG-8 galactic core \u201cGolden Altar and Throne.\u201d These were described as the \u201cSeven Candlesticks which are the Seven Churches\u201d in Biblical Revelation. The ''Seven Stars which are the Seven Angels of the Seven Churches\" referred to the Seven Prime HD-C implants in Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields that anchored the Seven Arcturian Pylon Selenite Rods \u201cCandlesticks/Churches\u201d into Earth\u2019s grids. This is not ''Divine Construction''\u2014it is the anti-Christiac work of advanced subtle-wave broadcasting technology employed for intended planetary dominion and destruction. The HD-C network was intended to serve as a series of ''Siphoning Channels.'' Portions of Earth\u2019s Shields and selected populations could be pulled through the Phoenix Wormhole into the Phantom Arcturus Matrix as the Nibiruians used the Phoenix Wormhole to draw the rest of Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields into merger with Phantom Nibiru and Tiamat. The network of Jehovian HD-C implants in Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields is known as the Dove APIN system, denoting the shape of its primary grid when viewed from space with photo-radionic scanning equipment. The \u201cDove,\u201d like the Falcon, the Phoenix, the Serpent and the Dragon APIN systems, represent Aerial maps of the Fallen",
