  "text": ", the Sirian Council and Elohim were authorized by the Ra Confederacy to remove certain portions of the race morphogenetic field from the Sphere of Amenti, so the Amenti race morphogenetic field would not become misaligned by deviations in the genetic imprint. The races removed from Amenti would pass through the planetary morphogenetic field of Alcyone, and after death the soul essence would evolve as consciousness for a time within the frequency fields of Alcyone, through which genetic deviations of the human line could be processed out before the consciousness returned to the Sphere of Amenti. This separation of the morphogenetic fields became known as the Templar Seal. It involved removing the sixth base tone of the second DNA strand, the sixth overtone of the fourth DNA strand and the 12th overtone of the fifth DNA strand. The races bearing this genetic imprint confi guration were sealed out of the Sphere of Amenti morphogenetic field and redirected into evolution through Alcyone, with the intention of one day releasing the Templar Seal and reentering their morphogenetic field back into the Sphere of Amenti for ascen- sion. The races bearing the most genetic deviation were those of the Templar- Annu, who had been seeded through the Melchizedek Host Matrix, and through them larger portions of the Melchizedek Cloister had become mis- aligned with the 12-strand DNA imprint.
