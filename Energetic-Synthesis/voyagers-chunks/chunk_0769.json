  "text": "con- sciousness experiences itself as being. There is an order to the universe, and there are indeed natural laws of energy mechanics that govern and uphold the functioning of that universal order. Ascension represents the path of order through which consciousness evolves through a structured, multi dimensional system. In terms of planetary ascension, this process involves the transmutation of particles and anti-particles into progressively less dense states of matter, through which a planetary body is able to evolve from the lower dimensional frequency bands into the higher dimensional reality fields of the 15-dimen- sional scale. Ascension also involves the understanding of morphogenetic fields, or the form-holding energy constructions that allow matter and anti- matter particles to build into individuated form. The process of personal ascension involves precisely the same process, as the human is part of the greater morphogenetic field of the planet, and the progression of dimensional ascension of the human and the planet are intimately intertwined. Without delving into the technical mechanics of the ascension process, let us just say that planets and people ascend/evolve through the dimensional scale through the intrinsic universal laws of energy which form and hold together the structures of consciousness that form identities in time. Spiritual ascension is not separate fr",
