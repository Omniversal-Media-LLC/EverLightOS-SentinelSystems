To the body and mind these events will indeed appear as if they had taken place physically, and in one sense they have, for the physical sensory imprint is valid within the present moment focus of the consciousness. The remembered events were real but they took place within the future where matter-solidity had not yet caught up with them. When intersecting these future events with a conscious mind focused in the present the events will immediately be translated into the codes of the mental body, thus giving solidity of form to the remembered events. Memory is stored within the body cells and DNA, and so the events experienced in a future time are recorded there, but they will be remembered consciously only as the mental body grows to the point where it is able to translate that stored data into symbols. The mental body can only translate impulses that fall within its range of frequency, so within abductions of this kind the remembered events will unfold \u201cover time\u201d as the mental awareness grows and expands its frequency rate to translate a greater variety of \u201cimpulse packages.\u201d Alterations that take place during such experiences may take the form of physical manipulations, as well as that of remembered events.
