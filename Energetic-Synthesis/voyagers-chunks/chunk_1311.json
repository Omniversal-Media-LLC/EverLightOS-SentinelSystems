Ascensions to Tara, through the Halls of Amenti, con- tinue for populations stationed within the Bridge Zone and the Halls of Amenti close to populations stationed on Phantom Earth in the D-3 time continuum cycle. The rate of data transmission through the Hall of Records slows on Bridge Zone Earth and the Hall of Records closes to Phantom Earth. As Earth passes out of alignment with the Holographic Beam, the Seven primary vortices on Earth and Phantom Earth enter their closing and deactivation cycle. 39. January 1, 2022: Earth's Seventh Vortex\u2014Andes Mountains-\u2014Closes. Infusions of D-5-D-7 Frequency through Earth\u2019s Grid Cease and Accelerated Assembly of DNA Strands 5 and 6 Ends. The Mass Ascension Cycle Comes to a Close as the Halls of Amenti Close to the Masses. The Grids of Earth and Tara Completely Separate. The natural seal within Earth\u2019s seventh vortex re-seals, closing and deacti- vating the seventh vortex in the Andes Mountains. Following this re-seal- ing, the Earth's grid begins to slow in particle pulsation speed to the Bridge Zone-Agartha time continuum rhythm and the infusions of D-5-D-7 energy, that had been running through Earth's grid, cease. In the absence of these UHF energy infusions, the acceleration of assembling and activat- ing DNA strands 5-7 ends. Humans who do not organically carry the imprint for the fifth and sixth DNA str",
