The Jehovian frequencies would automatically emerge with the release of each corresponding natural Seal, due to the Jehovian HD-C implants, ''Angels,'' placed relative to the natural Seals. The Jehovians knew that the '' Horsemen'' would bring death and destruction, just as the Jehovian Annunaki and Annu-Elohim intended them to do so.
