  "text": "is customary when CDT-Plate translations are initiated on Earth, three individuals are chosen by the Eieyani Priests to hold one of three \u201cCDT-Plate Speakers Contracts,\u201d through which translations of the CDT-Plates are returned to the human collective. Ashayana was chosen, by the Eieyani Priests of Ur, as the First CDT-Plate Speaker and mentor to the later Second and Third CDT-Plate Speakers in contemporary times, due to her reincarnational history, much of which she had conscious memory from birth and of which the Eieyani Priests are fully aware. In the \u201cChrist Drama\u201d of 2000 years ago, Ashayana, then an Essene woman named Miriam (born 5 BC-37 AD), had served as the Third CDT-Plate Speaker. Miriam served this role in collaboration with two Essene men historically known as John the Baptist (31 BC-34 AD), then First CDT-Plate Speaker and Jesheua Melchizedek (12 BC-27 AD), then Second CDT-Plate Speaker and leader of the Essene \u201cChristian Movement\u201d (known as \u201cJesus\u201d in the Bible). Prior to her CDT-Plate Speakers Contract as Essene Miriam, with others incarnating from the Eieyani collective, Ashayana had served as CDT-Plate Speaker and Eieyani Priest numerous times during early Lemurian, Atlantian, Hindu, Celtic-Druid and Egyptian historical periods. The history of Ashayana\u2019s recent reincarnational involvement with CDT-Plate Speaker Contracts on Earth began with her incarnation",
