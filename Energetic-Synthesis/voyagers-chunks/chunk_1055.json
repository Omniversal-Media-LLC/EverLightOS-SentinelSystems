During Magnetic Peaks, natural interdimensional portal win- dows briefly open, allowing unencumbered transit between dimensional bands. Magnetic Peaks also occur between the Merkaba Spirals of Harmonic Universes, through which the Merkaba Fields of a dimension in one Har- monic Universe blend with the Merkaba Fields of the corresponding dimen- sion one Harmonic Universe up; these blending periods are called Harmonic Magnetic Peaks. Each Harmonic Universe has three dimensions, each of the three dimensions representing a base tone, overtone or resonant tone, within the 15-dimensional scale. D-1, D-4, D-7, D-10, and D-13 are base tone dimensions. D-2, D-5, D-8, D-11 and D-13 are overtone dimensions. D-3, D- 138",
