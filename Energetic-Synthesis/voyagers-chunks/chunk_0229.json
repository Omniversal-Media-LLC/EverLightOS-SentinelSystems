  "text": "Tara while genetic diversity began to fragment the human species. Many attempts of reeducation were made by the cultures who had seeded the original prototype, but the digression became too great. The humans who had originally been intended as Tara\u2019s guardians were losing the ability to fulfill that role. The Turaneusiam had originally possessed great power and knowledge. As the genetic digression continued distortions in their knowledge began to manifest in instinctual behaviors, within which abuse and misuse of power was prevalent. Tara's resources and other life forms were more and more abused and misused. The creators of the Turaneusiam, after a millennium of attempted reeducation, finally decided to allow the species to continue its digression into its natural end\u2014the self-termination of the species, which nearly occurred during events of 550 million years ago. The prototype was preserved through those Turaneusiam who had retreated underground or resettled in other systems within the three-dimensional universe. The legends now common in your culture involving Atlantis and Lemuria have emerged through the genetic memory into your times from that prehistoric reality. Though \u201cAtlantis\u201d was not the actual name of this civilization the drama your legends associate with it are actual translations of some of the events that occurred during this period of original human creation.",
