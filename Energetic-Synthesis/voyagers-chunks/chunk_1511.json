The 12 Signet Tribes and Races List: The list of Signet An- cestral Ascendancy, which reveals the 12 Signet Tribes appointed as Guardians and \u201cKeepers of the Keys\u201d for each of the I2 Universal Star Gates and their earthly correspondences. The 12 Signet Tribes and Races List traces the genetic lineage of the 5 Palaidia Urtite-Cloister Angelic Human Seed Races that founded the 12 Signet Tribes of Seeding-3 up to their contemporary race lines. Through revelation of Signet Ancestral Ascendancy, we can identify the original Signet Tribe from which our current genetic code originally emerged, and thus we can reclaim the knowledge of the \u201c Signet Council \u201d to which we presently belong. This information, recorded on CDT Signet-Plate-12, allows us to identify the Core Signet Key Codes upon which our personal DNA Templates are built, so we know to which of the 12 Star Gates our DNA Template is ''Keyed.'' Identifying which of the 12 Tribes represents our predominant genetic lineage enables us to discover the core ''Master Symbol-Color - Ton '' Keys we need to rapidly initiate accelerated \u201cFire Letter\u201d activa tion sequences in our dormant 12-DNA Templates, to expedite embod- iment of our personal D-12 Inner Christos \u201cMaharic Shield\" Template. \u2022 Progress",
