The Corteum technology utilizes inter-time manipulations intended to create \"minute time rips\" into the Phantom Matrix in regions connecting to the Seven Jehovian Seal sites. Through these \"minute time rips.\" which represent a type of worm- hole bridge, the UIR intends to build up sufficient sub-space photo-sonic \"charge\" within the Axiatonal Line system of Parallel Earth. The photo-sonic charge is intended to be progressively stored and amplified in the Parallel Earth Planetary Shields until 2008, at which time the charge is intended to be split into two \"Phantom Electrostatic ionic pulses.\" One pulse is to be sent back in time to the original 10,500 BC creation of the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes, the other into \"future time\" in the Phantom Earth time cycle. The \"past\" pulse will connect the 10,500 BC Atlantian period of Phantom Earth, in which the Luciferian Rebellion takeover attempt succeeded, to our present time con- tinuum line. The \"future\" pulse will connect the \"future\" of Phantom Earth, which evolved from the successful Phantom Earth Luciferian Conquest \u201cpast\u201d, to our present time continuum.
