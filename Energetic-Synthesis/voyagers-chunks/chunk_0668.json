  "text": "Origins and the Fall Cataclysm of Tara 550,000,000 YA Approximately 550 million years ago the Power-generator Crystals deep underground in Alania exploded, due to the Templar Solar Initiates\u2019 misuse of power from Tara\u2019s planetary core. This created a chain reaction of implosions within Tara\u2019s planetary grid. Portions of Tara\u2019s grid were blown apart and frag- mented, becoming detached from the Morphogenetic Field of the planet. Por- tions of Alania were immediately destroyed and the entire planet suffered the effects of rapid pole reversal. For a period of two days Tara ceased to rotate on its axis. It took 10,000 years to re-stabilize Tara\u2019s environment, during which time the few surviving Taran races still on-planet retreated permanently under- ground. Descendants of those civilizations who survived this disaster still \ufb02our- ish within elaborate underground communities. Surface life also returned to Tara following this 10,000 year period of healing. Because portions of the planet\u2019s energy structures had been ripped from the main planetary grid, planet Tara could not continue its evolution of dimensional ascension into the Third Harmonic Universe. Tara could not re-emerge with the energy grid of its dimension-7 counterpart Gaia, until its own grid system was repaired. Tara became trapped in the tracks of time within the Second Harmonic Universe. The Fall to Harmonic Universe-1",
