We will elaborate upon this adjacent Earth system in sections to follow, but for now we will return to our discussion of holographic inserts and how they are presently being used to direct the perceptions of your people. Previously we mentioned that holographic inserts using themes popular within your traditions were being used in \u201ctest runs\u201d of the project. Most of these tests were orchestrated using individuals or small groups of people, in which scenarios pertinent to these subjects were created and the emotional reaction patterns of the participants were studied. Attention is paid to perceptual range of the human subject as the Zeta are aware that are great variations among the populace in regard to perceptual ability. They are attempting to find a consensual mean of frequency through which they can broadcast the holograms and hope to use the frequency fence to block out frequency bands that do not fall within that average range. In this way large masses of people can be \u201ctuned into\u201d the particular range of the holographic insert and blocked from receiving frequency that would create sense data that was in contradiction to the ill",
