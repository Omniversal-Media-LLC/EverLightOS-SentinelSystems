  "text": "s of the human body is a complicated process of multidimensional physics. We do not have enough time to teach you of the intricacies involved in this process. For this reason our future work will focus upon bio-energetic techniques you can use to facilitate the process, rather than on laborious conceptual foundations such as those presented in this book. It is important that you comprehend the basic concepts of these energetic dynamics so future exercises will make some bit of rational sense to you. To take this opportunity for accelerated evolution, you simply need to know how to use your mind to direct frequency. You also need to know what frequencies are available at what times via the Stellar Spirals, how to bring these frequencies into your bodies and where to direct them once you have drawn them in. Frequencies from the Stellar Spirals are drawn into your body via the higher-dimensional chakras; the chakra centers located outside of the body that are primarily dormant at this time and do not transmit frequency directly into the lower, in-body chakras. By intention you can use the Stellar Spiral frequencies to activate these higher chakra centers, then draw energy from the Spirals through the activated chakras into the lower chakras and the appropriate Star Crystal Seals. 483",
