The Soul Matrix families themselves were also transplanted to other Matrices that had their organization and energies intact. There were numerous Host Matrix families involved, all of them from other dimensional bands. Each of them had their own orientation and methods, and brought their own unique perspectives and energetic coding to the experiment. The human strain would have been lost to digression and self-termination if it had not been for this intervention. You would not be \u201cwho you are today\u201d had these events not transpired. During these centuries of re-training and genetic reorganization the humans evolved. Some were unable to make the transition successfully and became \u201cextinct\u201d in your terms. Those humans who had interbred with the animal presence indigenous to Earth had the most difficult time with reorganization. Their biologies could not undergo the transmutations involved in the development of intellect as you know it, and so they met with demise, usually due to changing environmental circumstances. Other humans, whose strain had not been overly diluted by animal interbreeding were able to make the transition successfully. The perceptual quality you know as intellect was born during the first Seeding of the 12 tribes, between 20 and 25 million years",
