  "text": "evolutionary progression. Keylontic Science is the study of morphogenetic fields and the processes by and through which conscious- ness becomes manifest. Units of identity from the central creative source move through and build themselves up within the following states of being, to become manifest forms and individuated identities as they evolve within the 15-dimensional system: 1. Morphogenetic Partiki Units of pure undifferentiated consciousness, 2. Morphogenetic Partiki Strands, 3. Morphogenetic Partiki Grids, 4. Morphogenetic Keylons, 5. Keylon Code Crystal Body composite morphogenetic fields, 6. Electromagnetic Merkaba Fields, 7. Bio-energetic fields and chakra systems, 8. Pre-matter Nadial substance, 9. Particle and Anti-particle construction, 10. Simple to complex matter and anti-matter forms, elemental composites, biological life-forms and sentient conscious identity and 11. Expanded compound morphogenetic identities of pure sentient conscious- ness, possessing complex 15-dimensional Crystal Body structures.Keylon- tic Science studies and implements the natural laws and dynamics inherent to the creation of matter and the evolution of consciousness. The Science of Keylonta can be viewed as the science of Light and Sound (electro-tonal units of Partiki), the Sub-conscious Symbol Codes (Light-Symbol Codes that program the Crystal Body and operate on a sub- conscious level",
