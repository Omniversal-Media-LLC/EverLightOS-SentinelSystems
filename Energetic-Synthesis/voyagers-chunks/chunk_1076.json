Each Euiago contains one Pardo and one Reiago. A planet\u2019s progression through one time continuum creates a 45\u00b0 shift in the angular rotation of particle spin, or 1/8th of a full 360\u00b0 rotation of parti- cles, thus one continuum represents one dimensional Octave. One Octave = a 4,426-year track of time. One dimension contains two time continua, or two Octaves. A planet\u2019s progression through one dimension creates a 90\u00b0 shift (2 shifts of 45\u00b0) in the angular rotation of particle spin, or one-fourth of a full 360\u00b0 rotation, thus one dimension represents one Harmonic Quadrant. One Quadrant = an 8,852-year track of time. Three dimensions, three Quadrants, or six Octaves (time continua) represent one Harmonic Universe. One Har- monic Universe = a 26,556-year track of time. As a planet progresses through the first two Pardo Octaves, the angular rotation of particle spin shifts 90\u00b0 from its original position. Upon entering the two Reiago Octaves in the parallel universe, the angular rotation of parti- cle spin undergoes a 90\u00b0 reverse rotation, bringing the angular rotation of particle spin back to its original position. As the planet completes the final two Pardo Octaves, returning from the parallel universe, th",
