Shifting a present-moment Time Vector into a different Time Contin- uum that has a more desirable future outcome than that of the Time Con- tinuum of which our present Time Vector is a part, can be achieved from the present. But such a Time Continuum shift can be accomplished only within the natural mechanics of physics that govern the interdependant dynamics of race, planetary, galactic and universal Time Cycles . One cannot simply choose to shift to a different Time Continuum at any moment-point in time; Time Continuum shifts can be made only in present-moment points within which other Time Continua interface with the present-moment Time Vec- tor through vibrational co-resonance. This principle of \u201cCo-resonant Continuum Alignment\u201d applies to the smaller time cycles that govern evolution of an individual through one life- time, and also to the larger Planetary Time Cycles that govern a planet\u2019s evolution through the Density Levels of our 15-Dimensional Time Matrix. Stellar Activations Cycles (SACs) are points of planetary, galactic and uni- versal \u201cCo-resonant Continuum Alignment\u201d during which the divergent frequency rhythms characteristic to various planetary, galactic and universal Time Continua temporarily come into a state of vibrational",
