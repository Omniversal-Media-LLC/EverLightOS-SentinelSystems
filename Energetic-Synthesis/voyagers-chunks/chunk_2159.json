UIR, \u201cWINGMAKERS\u201d THE LABYRINTH WEAPON AND 2011 A collective of renegade Necromiton-Andromie/Jehovian Anunnaki hybrid Nephilim races, now members of the UIR, have been initiating progressive covert con- tact with a group of Humans known as the Labyrinth Group\u201d. The Labyrinth Group is a covert collective of humans directly involved with the 1972-1973 archaeological discover- ies known as the \"Ancient Arrow Wingmakers Site\" in New Mexico. Using their usual talents of truth-twisting, dispensation of partial knowledge and embellished disinforma- tion, this Nephilim group, which is code named the \u201cCorteum\u201d, have deceived the Laby- rinth Group into assisting them to create a crystalline-scalar-mechanics based weapons technology. In order for the UIR to take advantage of this final 2011 invasion opportu- nity, they must re-activate the Seven Jehovian Seal sites on Earth in order to use the \"Seven Trumpets\" technologies of D-7 Phantom Arcturus to upcap the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes. The Seven Jehovian Seal sites will have been re-calibrated to a Level 9 12- Code Pulse 7 by 2011. The technology the Corteum has inspired the Labyrinth Group to create is intended to assist the UIR in re-activating the seven Jehovian Seals on a Phan- tom Matrix electromagnetic pulse, to allow for fulfillment of the UIR\u2019s OWO final vic- tory.
