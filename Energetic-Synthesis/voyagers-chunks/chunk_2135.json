In the original Amenti Ascension schedule, the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period was due to take place in 2017, at which time regions of Earth that could sustain 4.5 accretion level would fully transfer into the Inner Earth Bridge Zone Time Continuum. Areas and populations that could not sus- tain 4.5 accretion (all of 4th DNA Strand and one-half of 5th Strand activation) would separate and be drawn into the Phantom Earth/Phantom Matrix Sub-time Dis- tortion Cycle. Elements of the \u201cmanifest hologram\u201d that \u201cfell to Phantom Earth\u201d would literally appear to have \u201cdisappeared\u201d from the face of the Earth, to the per- ceptions of populations successfully achieving the Bridge Zone Time Cycle Shift. Pres- ently, though posing more inherent risk of failure, the Emergency Crisis Intervention program of the Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket provides for greater opportunities of population protection not originally possible within the dynamics of physics of the Bridge Zone Project. The \u201c4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble\u201d and the Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket sur- rounding it, will allow Earth to pass through the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, through which progressive bi-polarization and separation of the global particle field and populations into the Bridge Zone and Phantom Matrix Time Continua will occur. By the end of 2006 this",
