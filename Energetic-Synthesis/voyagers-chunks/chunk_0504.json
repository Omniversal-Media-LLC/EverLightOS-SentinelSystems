Next place your attention within the body and imagine that you are scanning its energy signature from the inside out. Begin at the feet and slowly sweep your attention upward through the body, becoming aware of the inner structures of bone, tissue, organs etc. As you scan, notice any area that gives you a different impression, sensation, image or feeling than other areas. You may feel a slight tingling in the body target area, a sense of heat or cold, or you may get mental imagery of color change or a mental picture of the body area to which the Subconscious Mind is guiding you for memory retrieval. Some people may receive a direct language translation from the Subconscious Mind, in which a thought such as \u201cthe left knee\u201d may come to your awareness. If you focus your attention clearly and keep your mind still you will receive some indication from the Body Consciousness as to what area of the body holds the memory in question. \u2022Once you have the target body area, mentally \u201cLasso\u201d this area with a circle of energy within your mind\u2019s eye, keeping the clear intention that you will retrieve the pertinent memory within the dream state. You may also want to make a note of the body target in your notebook. Prior to Sleep You may choose your target at any time then keep your notebook",
