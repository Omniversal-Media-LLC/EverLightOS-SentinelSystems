The Subconscious Mind is the portion of your personal identity that manifests as the physical body form and the crystalline blueprint within the molecular structure. It represents the \u201cBody Consciousness.\u201d It is this portion of identity that is accessed when using techniques such as hypnosis. The Subconscious Mind translates energy signatures from the dimensional Unified Fields of energy into perceptual data such as light, sound, taste, smell, touch, temperature, objectified form and linear passage through time. Working co-creatively with the other Components of Mind the Subconscious Mind creates the holographic illusion of 3-dimensional matter, objectified space and linear passage through time. Keylontic Symbol Codes are the languages of the Subconscious Mind. The Subconscious Mind translates thoughts, ideas and beliefs into Keylontic Symbol Codes of light, sound and electromagnetic standing wave patterns that direct the morphogenetic Keylon structure of the body. Thoughts will thus affect the health or disease of the body, as their biological Keylontic translations will either assist or impede the flow of energy between the body, the personality and the Soul Matrix. The Reasoning Mind can use Keylontic Symbol Codes to direct the processes of the Subconscious Mind and body and to access information store",
