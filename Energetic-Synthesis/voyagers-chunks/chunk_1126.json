The speed of particle pulsation in the par- ticle universe D-2 would be the speed at which anti-particles pulsate in D-1 of the parallel universe. Earth\u2019s D-2 particles are stationed within the same dimensional Uni fied Field as the D-l anti-particles of parallel Earth: Particle D-2 = Anti-particle D-1. Particle D-3 = Anti-particle D-2. Particle D-4 = Anti-particle D-3, etc. The frequency bands that make up the D-2 particles of Earth are the same frequency bands that make up the D-1 anti-particles of Parallel Earth. Earth\u2019s D-3 particles co-exist with parallel Earth\u2019s D-2 anti-particles. Parallel Earth\u2019s D-2 anti-particles co-exist with Earth\u2019s D-3 particles, etc. When observing Earth\u2019s D-3 landscape (which are the dimensional fre- quency bands that appear solid to a consciousness stationed in D-4 of the par- ticle universe) one perceives the contours of D-3 particle and D-2 anti- particle Earth. It is important to realize this intimate relationship between the particle content of Earth and anti-particle Earth, if one is to understand the reality fields in which Agartha, the Inner Earth, takes place. In view of the above dimensional particle and anti-particle relationships, the three levels of Earth\u2019s planetary body and those of the parallel Earth can be understood as follows: Earth's D-2 elemental body = anti-particle",
