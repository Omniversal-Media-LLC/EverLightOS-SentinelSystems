Follow- ing Earth\u2019s 2006 passage through the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, areas under Quatra Phase Merkaba/Meajh\u00e9 Zone protection cannot be intrinsically com- promised by UIR activities. Meajhe Zones may suffer a small degree of temporary instability if UIR infiltration of Trion Zones is extensive, but Meajh\u00e9 Zones will re- stabilize to complete the Bridge Zone time continuum shift in 2012. If UIR is successful in eroding the Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal in Trion Field areas, they will move forth with their intended Illuminati OWO agenda, Frequency Fence and \"First Contact\" drama. In this case, populations within Meajh\u00e9 Zones will be most protected from the effects of OWO progression.
