These frequency infusions have sufficiently increased the particle pulsation rhythm of Earth's D-2 core and elemental particle field, and Earth\u2019s D-3 atmospheric particle field. Further D-4 fre- quencies will be able to run through Earth\u2019s D-2 and D-3 particle bases on 1/1/2000, when the D-4 Solar Spiral begins to align with Earth's core. D-4 is a primary base tone dimension and D-2 is a primary overtone dimension within the 15-dimensional scale. When the full D-4 frequency spectrum of the Solar Spiral begins to permeate Earth\u2019s D-2 core and elemental par- ticle field on 1/1/2000, an interdimensional Resonant Tone will be struck as D-2 overtone and D-4 base tone frequencies merge. This interdimensional Resonant Tone allows Earth\u2019 s 3-dimensional particle \ufb01eld to raise in pulsation rhythm, to receive the progressive Transmutative Stellar Wave Infusions and Stellar Activations that will allow Earth to rise into the HU-2 time cycles for merger with Tara. Without this interdimensional Reso- nant Tone, created through the merger of Earth\u2019s D-2 core frequencie",
