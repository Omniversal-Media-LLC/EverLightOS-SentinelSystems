They removed from Tara the morphogenetic field through which Tara drew its energy imprint for its grid line structure and matter form. By removing this form-holding energy field from Tara's core, Tara could no longer build a bridge of frequency between its core and Gaia's core at the eighth-dimension Metagalactic core. This removal of Tara's interior morpho- genetic field was done out of necessity. If the morphogenetic field had remained within Tara's core, Tara's progression of dimensional ascension into the Third Harmonic Universe would have continued, up to a point. When the planetary grid of Tara had pulled in the remaining frequency bands from the Unified Fields of dimensions 5 and 6, through the morphogenetic field at its core, it would next begin to pull in the frequencies of the seventh dimen- sion and begin its ascent into the Gaian planetary grid structure. This is the natural path of evolution for a planet. However, if the seventh-dimensional frequency bands entered and expanded Tara's morphogenetic field, certain portions of t",
