To the soul-self, the 12 immediate HU-1 incarnates that are in its incar- national family are recognized as living sub-personality fragments of its own identity, whose reality simultaneously takes place within the dimensional bands contained within the soul-self\u2019s DNA. The DNA represents electro- magnetically encoded, digital data imprints of the other living portions of your identity, which are stationed within other time continua. Through the DNA, the experiential reality of other-time incarnates is implanted into the body cells, to create a living Cellular Memory of your simultaneous partici- pation within other fields of time. The DNA operates as a window in time through which your consciousness can perceive and participate in activity taking place in the other time continua. As you assemble DNA, you expand the particles of your body and awareness into higher-dimensional time cycles, and progressively open the windows through time into other space-time coor- dinates within other time cycles.
