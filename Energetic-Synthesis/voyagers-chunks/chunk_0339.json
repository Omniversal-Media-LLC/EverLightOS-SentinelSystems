We have previously referred to these \u201csound genetics\u201d as \u201cthe language of energy, light and sound,\u201d the language of Keylonta. (See page 22.) \u201cSound genetics\u201d are part of this language, and they have great bearing upon the human condition. What we call the Keylonta Codes exist within the cellular pattern of your biology, and also within the literal strands of DNA. They represent the specific sound patterns that combine to form the frequency bands of your biological matter, and thus set the base frequency codes within which your conscious focus will take place. Depending upon the arrangement and activation of these codes, you will have either a great range of perceptual and experiential freedom or a very limited range of focus while you are within a matter-based form. When your species experienced the Soul Matrix transplants thousands of years ago the DNA held certain Keylonta Code patterns that were set by the Host Matrix families. They carefully disassembled the original codes within your DNA and replaced these \u201celectrified sound patterns\u201d with those from their own Matrix organizations. Like the interior of your cells, the Soul Matrices and the Time and Energy Matrices are composed and directed by these organizations of \u201celectrified sound particles.\u201d These particles are compos",
