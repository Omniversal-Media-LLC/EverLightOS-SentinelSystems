  "text": "reality fields that differ from our own, within unrecognized parallel universe systems or that visitations could occur through inter-time structures that allow interface between various periods of space-time. Quantum physics theory presents new possibilities for validating the existence of parallel, interdimensional and inter-time worlds, but our scientific understanding of such realities is in its infancy. The facts are: Otherworlds, supporting advanced civilizations, may appear unseen from today\u2019s scientific perspective because they exist in dimensions (or fields of frequency) unknown to contemporary science. They may exist in parallel universes (which Quantum physics theory is only beginning to suggest.). Non-terrestrial Visitors, reported throughout history, could originate from these unseen worlds or may visit Earth via time travel through unidentified inter-time structures. Contemporary mathematical computation may not possess the sophistication to factor multi-dimensional reality systems into workable theories, from which clear hypotheses as to the locations of Otherworlds can be drawn. These possible explanations for the apparent invisibility of other inhabited worlds are equally as valid as the scientific assumption that such worlds cannot exist simply because science has yet to discover them. Otherworlds may not exist for science, but they have always existed for the",
