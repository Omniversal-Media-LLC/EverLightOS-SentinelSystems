  "text": "ot real, it only proves that you can stimulate or recreate a version of that experience through artificial means by activating the innate cellular alphabet of fixed electromagnetic code patterns. In actual UFO/Visitor abductions (and during the normal sensory translation process), the entire alphabet and its translators are used by the Soul Matrix and body consciousness with purposed intent (or intelligently directed purpose) and the mechanics of their language are understood by that intelligence. In these cases the alphabet is used to convey meaning. The perceptual experience created through the alphabet is not random and meaningless as it is within your experiments. Your illusion of three-dimensionally solid matter is created in just the same way, the only difference is that different \u201cword combinations\u201d (electromagnetic impulse sequence patterns) are used to carry different meanings. Actual abduction encounters are no more or less real than is your perceptual experience of three-dimensional reality. Both involve the translation of experiential information that organically exists as particle groupings of electromagnetic energy into symbolic experiential representations of the reality that exists as energy patterns. We repeat: Your experience of three-dimensional matter is no more real or valid than the experiences encountered during actual Visitor",
