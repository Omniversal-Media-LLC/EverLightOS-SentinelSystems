The human collective represents part of the Earth\u2019s matter body, and if the collective accretion level of human beings remains at its present 3\u20143.5 average, the accretion level and vibration rate of the Earth\u2019s grid will be held down. In the Bridge Zone time continuum, the Earth\u2019s accretion level will be raised from its current 2.5- to a 3.5-level of accretion. In order for the Earth's grid to reach this accelerated level of accre- tion in time to begin entering the Bridge Zone by 2012, most of the human populations must be able to reach no less than a 4.5-accretion level. If the majority of the populations cannot reach the 4.5-accretion level, the vibra- tion rate of Earth will not reach 3.5 and the planet will not shift into the Bridge Zone Time continuum. In terms of a planet shifting into another time continuum, what is really taking place is that the pulsation rate of particles, within the three lev- 160",
