  "text": "the universe. You are like a royal family dethroned by jealous factions, and you can reclaim the territories and majesty that once were your own. Treat yourselves as the royalty that you are, and treat your fellow humans (regardless of their position) as beloved members of that lineage. In taking responsibility for your own emotional reality and committing to the healing and evolution of your personal being, you will emerge triumphant, one by one, into the palace of your awakened identity. Then you can begin to call the others home. Your species can heal, and it must if its continuation is to be secured. There are many, from many places willing to help you. But only you can reach for growth, only you have the power to command the fulfillment of your evolution. Only you have the ability to awaken yourselves to see the realities beyond the illusions of your three- dimensional world. Only while you are sleeping, unaware of the truth of your identity, can the Zeta and others bring harm to you. You cannot be manipulated by holographic inserts or forced matrix transplants if your senses have developed to the point of seeing behind them and your logic has grown to understand how to avert them. If your logical/intellectual awareness would get out of its own way, your emotional and intuitive facilities would bring your entire being into balance under the direction of the Soul Matrix. As",
