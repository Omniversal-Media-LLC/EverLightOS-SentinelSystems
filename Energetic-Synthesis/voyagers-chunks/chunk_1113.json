The DNA serves as the literal conduit through which that holographic program will project data from cellular memory into physical manifestation, much as a computer\u2019s circuitry allows the electronic data stored in memory to be projected onto the screen, into forms recognizable to human perception. Your external reality field is the screen upon which the thought-forms that are stored within your cellular memory program will be dis- played, and the DNA operates as the electromagnetic circuitry through which that memory comes into perceptual manifestation. 158",
