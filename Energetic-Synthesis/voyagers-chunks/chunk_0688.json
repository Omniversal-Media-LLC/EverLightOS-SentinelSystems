As the 12 DNA strands were assembled, the body form of the incarnate would progres- s ively transmute into a less dense state and ascend into HU-2 on Tara. Origi- nally only one Ea rth body was needed for this process, as the form would assemble the DNA patterns within the two 12-cycles in one very long lifetime and then transmute and ascend. The ascension occurred through the portal from the Sphere of Amenti to which the incarnate\u2019s dimensional band/time period was connected. Once passing through its dimensional portal into the Sphere of Amenti, the incar- nate could enter one of the other portal bridges, and appear on Tara in a future space/time coordinate, becoming free from HU-1. Through this pro- cess the consciousness of Tara\u2019s fragmented parts would be returned to Tara\u2019s planetary grid piece by piece, progressively de-densifying the matter particles of Earth and transmuting them back into Tara\u2019s grid. As the lost souls returned to Tara, so did the lost portions of Tara\u2019s morphogenetic field. Though the dynamics of this process are complicated, the principle is sim- ple. The portals within the Sphere of Amenti served as a time-portal structure through which the lost substance/energetic thrust of Tara could be returned, and the lost souls of Tara could return to their original identit",
