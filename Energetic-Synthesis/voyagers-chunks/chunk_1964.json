The Seed Crystal Seals control the speed at which fourth- dimensional Merkaba Fields will rotate, and so direct the pulsation rhythm of particles within each dimension. Along with the Seed Crystal Seals there are 15 more minute patterns of crystallized morphogenetic frequency that exist within the bio-energetic structure of a person or planet. Whereas the Seed Crystal Seals set the morphogenetic field into the center of each dimension, the other 15 seals are placed between dimensional bands and serve to regu- late the function of the Seed Crystal Seals.
