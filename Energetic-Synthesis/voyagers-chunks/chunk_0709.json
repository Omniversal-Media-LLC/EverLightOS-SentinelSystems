Those who lost their immortal genetic codes and did not leave Earth perished, along with many animal life-forms, as Earth's plan- etary environment was thrown into chaos. Earth would have been destroyed if the Breneau from HU-5 had not intervened. The Seal of Amenti and the End of the Electric Wars 5,508,100 YA The Breneau entities negotiated a treaty between these opposing fac- tions. In the agreement the Root Races of Earth would be allowed to evolve, but the Halls of Amenti\u2014the portals between Earth and Tara\u2014would be sealed to humans until the mutations within the genetic code of Root Races 3 and 4, which had contaminated the morphogenetic fields, could be reversed. ln terms of souls evolving out of HU-1, the sealing of the Halls of Amenti meant that they could evolve into the morphogenetic field of their Cloister Race and pick up DNA strands 7\u201412, but they could not pass through the Cloister morphogenetic field of their Root Race into the collec- tive Palaidorian morphogenetic field where DNA strands of the other Root Races, strands 4\u20146 could be assembled.
