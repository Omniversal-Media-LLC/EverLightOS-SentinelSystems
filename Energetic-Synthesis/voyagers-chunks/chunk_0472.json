  "text": "diagnose the probability, not just the possibility, as abduction affects hundreds of thousands of your people globally\u2014even in cases that appear to be \u201ctypical or \u201cclinical\u201d disorders\u2014screening is an invaluable tool. For if Visitor abduction is the cause behind the disorder, traditional modes of treatment will be ineffective in the long run! And using drug therapy to disguise the symptoms will only create a chemical dependence within the body, that will make later memory retrieval therapies more difficult to implement. You should also screen those already diagnosed with most \u201ctypical disorders,\u201d as true healing of those victimized by abduction can only occur through proper diagnosis and memory retrieval and assimilation therapies. If you care about your people you will begin to develop these screening techniques now and to implement them as soon as possible. People experiencing Visitor abduction do need treatment, and treatment begins with personal respect. Labeling such individuals as \u201cfreaks\u201d or viewing them as \u201cmental cases\u201d only keeps you blind and it harms them rather than healing them. There are many well meaning health practitioners who genuinely care about their patients, and to you we say \u201cplease have the courage to open your minds to the possibilities we have suggested and begin the intelligent research that is needed. Speak out about your findings and your feelings,",
