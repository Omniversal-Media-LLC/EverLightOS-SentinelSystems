The Second Round was delayed from its originally intended schedule due to warring with Fallen Angelic races and a resulting planetary cataclysm in 208,216 BC. The Third Round of Angelic Human evolution took place in 73,000 BC as the five 7-12 + 1 Strand DNA Template Cloister Races emerged through the five Urtite-Cloister races, carrying sub-harmonics of the specific DNA Template Star Gate Cor- relations characteristic to the specific Urtite-Cloister Race from which they emerged. The Fourth Round of Angelic Human evolution began shortly thereafter, as the five Root Races with 2-6 Strand + dormant 12-Strand DNA Templates began their progressive emergence into human incarnation in 71,000 BC , through their corresponding Cloister race of the five Cloister Races (see page 15). Each of the four Rounds of the Human Evolutionary Blueprint is designed to bring into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields during specific Time Vectors a designated portion of the D-12 Shield of Aramatena Christos Template. If the Cycle of the Rounds had proceeded without progressive Fallen Angelic interference, the four Rounds of th",
