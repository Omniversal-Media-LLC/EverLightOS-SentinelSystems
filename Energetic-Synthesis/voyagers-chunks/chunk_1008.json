In the future of Earth, between 4230 AD and 6443 AD, the Zeta/Dracos alliance has successfully overtaken the human world culture in that time period. This time period takes place within the First ascension cycle time continuum of Tara\u2019s 26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle, the natural path of evolution into which Earth would next evolve to become Tara, following completion of its present cycle in 4230 AD. The Sixth Root Race Muvarians and descendants of the present human races live there now in a Zeta-ruled society, controlled by Frequency Fence and Holographic Insert technology. These events are taking place now, in that future time-space coordinate. In order for the Zetas to retain c",
