  "text": "ion of Angelic Human visual/bio-stimulus images, with select pieces of Corteum control-program images mixed in among the Angelic Human artwork. One can detect the subtle difference in frequency between \u201chealthful\u201d Angelic Human images and \u201crepressive\u201d Nephilim/Corteum Intruder ET images by using the Maharic Seal Tech- nique, then sensing the energy signature behind the image. A deep, low, rumbling \u201cULF background cyclic vibration pulse\u201d can be easily sensed in the Corteum images. Angelic Human images will not have this ULF \u201cPhantom under-pulse,\u201d but rather, each image will carry a set of three subtle UHF \u201cinner sound tones\u201d that are \u201cfrequency keyed\u201d to 12th-sub-frequency band of D-6 and the 6th-DNA Strand Template. Angelic Human Wingmaker images were designed to frequency-trigger progressive activation of Human and Indigo DNA Strand Templates 4-5-6, to accelerate Pineal Gland and DNA Tem- plate 12-Code activation. _____________________________ 11.CDT-Plates are all under GA protection as of 1999. 555",
