Then, exhale sharply, directing the breath energy to a point at the center of the group circle.5 As you exhale, vi- sualize your Pillar replicating. One Pillar remains around you,6 and another replica expands outward around the entire group. Visualize a large Silver disc growing out from the group center point, 12 \u201d beneath the surface you are standing on, forming a platform upon which the group stands. This is the group Maharic Shield, through which the Um Shaddai Ur Pillar will electro magnetically ground into Earth\u2019s Maharic Shield. 4. Three breaths: Take three final breaths, and with each one, inhale and visu alize a stream of Pale Silver energy coming up through the feet from earth\u2019s core and simultaneously down from the Sun through the top of the head. . .the two streams of energy meeting to form one thick Silver stream at the Heart Chakra. Exhale Maharic frequency into the group center point. After the third energizing breath, simply breathe normally, as each exhale moves energy into the group center point. Stand with the group for a few moments and visualize the Um Shaddai Ur Pillar of Light emanat ing from the Sun, through the group Pillar and group Maharic Shield. . .and into the Earth core Maharic Shield ___________________________ 5.
