Following these erroneous beliefs they draw an equally erroneous conclusion that consciousness ends at the death of the physical body. Yet at the same time they are unable to identify the creative, intelligent force through which an ordered system, such as the body, could be created. Current scientific thought creates a paradox within itself, as an attempt is made to define the mechanics of infinite reality within the confines of the finite, 3- dimensional mind. This paradox can be overcome once it is realized that consciousness and intelligence predate the manufacture of the body, and transcend its finite life span. Once this is realized, science will be confronted with a whole new order of multidimensional reality, and a whole new science through which that multidimensionality can be understood. The process of ascension is not some quasi-religious concept based upon the meandering of the human mind. Ascension is a highly scientific process of multidimensional energy mechanics that represent the universal order through which con- sciousness experiences itself as being. There is an order to the universe, and there are indeed natural laws of energy mechanics that govern and uphold the functioning of that universal order. Ascension represents the path of order through which",
