The Guardians are confident that humanity will be able to do its part now,in order to ensure its own survival. Earlier in our discussions we have mentioned the existence of the Inner Earth, Agartha, which is located in a frequency modulation zone between Earth and Earth\u2019s double in the parallel universe. Agartha represents part of Earth, and like Earth, Agartha has three levels of the planetary body. The Earth\u2019s three primary body levels exist within dimensions 1, 2 and 3. There is a relationship of particle pulsation speed between Earth and her parallel dou- ble: The particle pulsation speed of Earth\u2019s D-2 = anti-particle pulsation speed of parallel Earth D-1. Earth\u2019s D-3 particle pulsation speed = that of parallel D-2, etc. The speed of particle pulsation within each dimensional band in the anti-particle universe is faster than that of the corresponding dimension in the particle universe. The particle pulsation speeds of the dimensional bands in the particle universe run one dimension behind those of the dimensional bands in the anti-particle universe. The speed of particle pulsation in the par- ticle universe D-2 would be the speed at which anti-particles pulsate in D-1 of the parallel universe. Earth\u2019s D-2 particles are stationed within t",
