  "text": "LS Seed Crystals, Star Crystals and Transmutation of the Human Body As Earth enters its cycle of Stellar Activations and Stellar Wave Infu- sions, humans also have the opportunity to participate in Activations and Infusions, which will accelerate the evolution of the DNA, body and con- sciousness and allow humans to enter the time continua of the Bridge Zone or Tara, for continued evolution. The process of Stellar Activations, as it applies to people, operates energetically in a way similar to that of planetary Activations. In planetary Activations, progressively higher-dimensional sound frequencies and light spectra run through the Earth's grid and three- dimensional particle base, as the Earth's Merkaba Fields link with and draw energy from the Stellar Spirals. In humans, the three Merkaba Fields of the physical, mental and emo- tional levels of the bio-energetic field draw energy from the Stellar Spirals via the Earth\u2019s three-dimensional Merkaba Fields and grid, through the higher- dimensional chakras. This energy then moves into the three-dimensional body via the lower-dimensional chakras. Once stellar frequency is pulled into the human bio-energetic field, it is passed into the multidimensional, per- sonal morphogenetic field of the human via Stellar Wave Infusions, just as stellar frequencies are added to the Earth\u2019s core morphogenetic field through Wave Infusions.
