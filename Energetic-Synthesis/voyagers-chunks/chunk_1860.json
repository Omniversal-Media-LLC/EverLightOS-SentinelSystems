Planetary chaos begins with release of Jehovian Seal-4. if the frequencies of Seal-4 and those before it are not manually realigned to a natural 12-Code- Pulse as they run through Earth\u2019s Templar. Organic Star Crystal Seals 1 and 2, and their corresponding unnatural Jehovian Seals-1 and -2, 2 activated in late May 2001\u2014the planetary effects of Jehovian Seal-1 and -2 release will begin manifesting between August 2001 and May 2002. The chaotic frequencies of Jehovian Seals 1 and 2 had been converted to a natural 12-Code-Pulse realignment via RRT s conducted in Kauai, Hawaii, when the Seals released in May 2001. Organic Seal-3 and its unnatural Jehovian Seal-3 counterpart 3 activated in late July 2001\u2014its chaotic frequencies had been converted to a natural 12-Code- Pulse via RRTs conducted in England when the Seal released in July 2001. Between August 15 and September 3, 2001, the UIR fully activated the Montauk-Phi-Ex-Falcon wormhole Port Interface Atlantian Pylon Implant Network (APIN) system, launching the sub-space sonic-scalar amplification pulse that passed through the Star Gate-2 Gru-AL Poi",
