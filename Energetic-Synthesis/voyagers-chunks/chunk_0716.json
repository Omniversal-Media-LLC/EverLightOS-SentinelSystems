Manifested as an extra D-4 fre- quency pattern within the second and third DNA strands, a blockage within the sec- ond and third chakras through which their energies could only merge through the fourth chakra, and as an energetic barrier between the frequencies of the second, third and fourth dimensions within the bio-energetic auric \ufb01eld, this created separation between the emotional, mental and astral identity aspects. Root Race 5 souls became responsible for integrating the soul fragments of the Lamanians and Atlanians of the Second Seeding and the Atlanteans and Lemurians of the Third Seed- ing, which manifest as blockages within the second-emotional body, third- mental body and fourth-astral body chakras and corresponding levels of the auric field. Seal released through assembly of the fourth DNA strand and inte- gration of soul fragments, which must occur before Seal of Amenti can release from DNA strand one. Human consciousness lost awareness of its relationship to Earth and the higher dimensions, and its species evolutionary memory, and souls of Root Races and Cloisters from the Third and Fourth Races could only evolve through the Fifth Root Race.
