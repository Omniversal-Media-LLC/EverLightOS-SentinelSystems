Through promotion of this false, patriarchal, externalized Christ Fallen Angelic Templar- Anunnaki Creed humanity\u2019s right to have a personal, loving and empowering relationship with Source-God and the Founders Races is denied. The false patriarchal creed of the Fallen Angelic Templar Solar Initiates and Fallen Angelic Annu-Elohim Anunnaki is designed to continually enslave, digress and dis-empower the Angelic Human lineage. The Templar Creed is promoted falsely under the name of a \u201cMelchizedek\u201d Creed. In contemporary times, the false Templar- Melchizedek Creed emerges through numerous guises under the names of various false \u201cFather God\u201d personifications that evolved after the fall of the Atlantian Islands in 9558 BC. Beginning with the Sirian-Nibiruian-Anunnaki-Drakonian false \u201cAnu\u201d Father-God personification in the ancient Sumerian cities, followed by the false Father-God personification of the competing Sirius A \u201cBipedal Dolphin People-Anunnaki\u201d and many other renditions of competing control dogmas, human religions have evolved as a snare for self-perpetuated enslavement.
