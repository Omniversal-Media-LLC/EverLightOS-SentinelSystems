For the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, during which time Earth\u2019s natu- ral magnetic fields normally collapse, the portions of Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields and corresponding geographical regions in Safe Zones will be drawn into full vibrational co-resonance with the 4.25-dimensional magnetic fields sustained in the Buffer Blan- ket. This will allow regions of Earth, and populations, that are able to achieve tempo- rary Quatra Phase Merkaba, to enter the Safe Zone of the 4.25 magnetic field region of the Buffer Blanket. The 4.25 magnetic field will create a stable D-4.25 \u201cEnergy Bubble\u201d within which the 3-dimensional particle base of Earth and its inhabitants will be protected from the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period frequencies that set atomic transmutation in motion. Though the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period will commence in 2006, its manifest effects will be temporarily delayed until 2012 due to the \u201c4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble\u201d. In the original Amenti Ascension schedule, the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period was due to take place in 2017, at which time regions of Earth that could sustain 4.5 accretion level would fully",
