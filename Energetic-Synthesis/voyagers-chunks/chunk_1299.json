On day two Earth begins and completes its D-8 Orion Activation, as the D-8 Orion/Meta-galactic Core Spiral aligns with the D-7 Arcturian Spiral and D-8 frequency runs through Earth\u2019s grid. Halfway through day two and halfway into day three Earth receives its D-9/D-10 Blue-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusion, through which D-9 base tone and D-10 overtone frequencies enter the morphogenetic fields of Earth, Tara and Gaia. On day three Earth begins and completes its D-9 Andromeda Activation, as the D-9 Andromeda Spiral aligns with the D-8 Orion Spiral and D-9 frequency runs through Earth\u2019s grid. Halfway through day three Earth receives its D-10/D-11 Sil- ver-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusion, through which D-10 base tone and D-11 overtone frequencies enter the morphogenetic fields of Earth, Tara and Gaia. This D-10/D-11 Silver-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusion brings the Three-day particle conversion period to a close, creating the final sep- aration of Earth\u2019s particle base into the Bridge Zone and D-3 Phantom Earth time cycles. On day one of the 3-day period the Keepers of the Blue Flame complete their D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core Activation, activating the ninth DNA strand and becoming ninth-level avatars able to initiate D-9 Andromeda Activations in others.",
