  "text": "experimentation with dimensional frequency blending they created a situation in which a minute hole was ripped into the \u201cfrequency pattern\u201d of the regions involved in the dimensional merge. The intended merger of dimensional fields was not successful as the hole would not allow the area of frequency blending to stabilize into a consistent particle code pattern that would allow for a stable linear time sequence to take hold. The blended-dimension reality field was kept open for several hundred years before the Zeta became aware of the hole. A great amount of energy from this blended region \u201cfell into\u201d the hole and systematically pulled in more and more energy. Black Holes will pull in first those forms that possess energy coding that is consistent with the coding of the particles that exist at the site of the hole. That is, the items to first disappear are those who's particle structures are in the continuum, or \u201cgrid strand,\u201d where the break in pattern has occurred. In the Zeta incident this particle compatibility emerged within certain elemental components of the outer atmosphere of their home planet. Over centuries there became an obvious depletion of this elemental component within their atmosphere, which is what led the Zeta to suspect that there was a problem with their dimensional blending project. The hole was finally located and identified by observing the rate and form",
