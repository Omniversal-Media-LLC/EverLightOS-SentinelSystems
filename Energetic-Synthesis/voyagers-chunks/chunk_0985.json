  "text": "ore in D-2 follows a natural path of interdi- mensional energy circulation, through which HU-1 through HU-5 are con- nected. Each Harmonic Universe has a Harmonic Time Cycle, such as that of HU-1, which is 26,556 years long. All of the Harmonic Time Cycles are synchronized through the particle pulsation rates within each of the 15 dimensions. When Earth enters the half-point in its second ascension cycle, its grid fuses with the grid of anti-particle Tara precisely because these Har- monic Time Cycles are synchronized. When Earth reaches its half-point, not only does a warp in space-time occur within HU-1, it occurs all the way up through the five Harmonic Universes. A time-warp portal opens all the way 114",
