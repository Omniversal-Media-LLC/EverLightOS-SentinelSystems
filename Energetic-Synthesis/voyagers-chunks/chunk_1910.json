The Partika perpetually circulate energy from the original Partiki through the Cosmic Matrix and the Particum perpetually draw energy from the Unified Field of the Cosmic Matrix back into the morphogenetic form of the Partiki, expanding its original form. Through this dynamic a perpetual motion, expanding and contracting universe and parallel universe are perpet- ually re-created and eternally sustained. Partiki can be viewed in spiritual terms as units of the identity of God, the cen- tral creative source. All things are composed of Partiki and thus all things, beings and consciousness are intrinsically holy as they are composed of and united through the eternal substance of God. This God-substance of Partiki allows for individuation of form and identity to be created, creates diversifica- tion through a greater field of unified consciousness and manufactures the morphogenetic design through which all individuation and manifestation takes place. 2. Partiki Grids: Partiki units group by like polarization, electrical Par- tika to Partika, magnetic Particum to Particum, forming strings of energy units called Partiki Strands. Partiki Strands group with other such strands to form geometrical \u201cfabrics\u201d or grids of electro-tonal, electromagnetic energy that serve as a template of light spectra and sound tones upon which particle and anti-particle structure forms.
