Root Race three Lumarians, now Lamanians, had strand one and the base codes of strand 2, their Ur- Antrian Cloister had these plus the imprint for 7-12. All of the races of the Second Seeding carried trace codes of the Pleia- dian-Sirian Dagos. Races of the Second and Third Seeding, like their ances- tors of the First Seeding, also carried grounding codes within their operational DNA strands, which contained partial frequency patterns for each of the 12 dimensions within the 12-strand Turaneusiam imprint. The grounding codes allowed each race to manifest with some degree of three- dimensional, physical matter density and also allowed for transmutation of the physical matter particles once the overtone activation codes were opera- tional. Though all of the races carried the grounding codes, not all could acti- vate them because of the Seal of Amenti. As long as the Seal of Amenti, the missing sixth overtone of the first DNA strand, was contained in their mor- phogenetic pattern, none of the races could activate the grounding codes of the higher dimensions. As races 3-5 of the Second and Third Seeding would be born with the Seals of Palaidor and Amenti, only those whose imprint contained the fourth DNA strand (the Fifth and Sixth Root Races) had the potential to activate all of the grounding codes to ascend.
