  "text": "In its true reality, the tree is not as you perceive it at all. It exists as glowing patterns of light geometries, energy oscillations and sound emanations. That is the true reality of a tree or any other object or being within your three-dimensional system. However, its solidity is apparent, and its solid reality is validated when that pattern of energy is viewed through the energy patterns you call the human body. Thus it is safe to say that the solid tree represents one aspect of the tree\u2019s reality. It is one form that the tree takes within the full pattern of its wholeness. The solid tree is no more real or unreal than any of its other aspects. All of them together are tree. So too is it the same for little grey ETs and spaceships and Visitors from other places. All exist as conscious energy patterns, and when perceived through the energy patterns you call the human body, the patterns appear as little grey ETs, spaceships and Visitors from other places. Or perhaps the energy patterns will appear as mountains, oceans or people walking around in three-dimensional human bodies. The experience of the little grey Visitor, the tree or the human and its three- dimensional world represent one aspect of a reality and identity that is multidimensional. By the way, if you stumble upon and stimulate the appropriate cells within the human organism, you can make people see trees also. Do",
