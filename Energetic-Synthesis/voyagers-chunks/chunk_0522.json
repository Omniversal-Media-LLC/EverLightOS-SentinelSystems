  "text": "The Exercise Begin the exercise by removing any tight clothing. (For greater comfort we recommend removing all clothing during the exercise.) Place the Keylonta Symbol Code Placement Chart and the essence oil within easy reach then recline on your back on a comfortable surface. Calm your mind and let all thoughts drift away from your attention. Focus on the rhythm of your breathing for a few moments and consciously slow the breathing rate until the body is relaxed. Give the command \u201cBody relaxed and receptive now\u201d to the body consciousness/ Subconscious Mind. This can be done mentally, but it is more effective if it is audibly whispered so that you can hear the command objectively as well as internally. Repeat the command slowly 3 times without interruption. Using the essence oil place a small \u201cdot\u201d of oil from your finger tip onto each of the body areas marked 1\u20135 on the Keylonta Symbol",
