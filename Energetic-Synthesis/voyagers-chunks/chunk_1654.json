In the early 1900s, Zeta- Zephelium races from an adjacent Time Matrix (see Voyagers I) managed to break through the Anunnaki NET, by forcing a \u201chole in the cap\u201d of a sealed, ancient Atlantian wormhole . This wormhole, one of two remaining from the technological abuses of ancient Atlantis, is an artificially created trans- dimensional, geophysical anomaly that has existed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of what is now Savannah, GA, since 10,500 BC. The two ancient Atlantian wormholes are in the Atlantic Ocean on Axiatonal Line 7 , at about 69.5\u00b0 W longitude off the eastern U.S. coast. The first wormhole is on horizontal Ley Line 3, the Star Gates-3-Bermuda/ 9-Bam Tso Tibet \u201cBermuda-Jerusalem-Afghanistan-Pakistan-Bam Tso-Nagasaki Line\u201d at 32\u00b0 N.
