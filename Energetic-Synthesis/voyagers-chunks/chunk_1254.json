The Frequency Fence plan can still be averted if the Interior Government stops all cooperation with the Resis- tance EBEs and refuses to allow the 2003 experiment to take place. In the event that the public landing of 2001 does occur, the Resistance Frequency Fence plan is still operational, and Earth populations will have until 2004 to assemble DNA to the 3.75 accretion level in order to protect themselves from the Frequency Fence. If the Frequency Fence plan is operational Guardian Visitors may stage mass sighting \u201c\ufb02y-by\u2019s\u201d, anytime between 1998-2004, in order to warn the populations that Earth changes will be coming due to the Frequency Fence. In the event that the Fre- quency Fence is averted by 2004, and severe Earth changes are not expected, Guardians will NOT stage mass \u201cfly-by\u2019s\u201d. We are hoping the Frequency Fence plan will be abandoned. Humanity can help this effort by trying to assemble and activate the fifth DNA strand in 8% of the pop- ulations by 2001. Presently an estimated 0.24% of global populations have the fifth strand assembled and activated. Reaching 8% by 2001 is not likely, but it is not impossible if humanity really tries to reach this goal. If this goal can be reached the Dracos-Zeta Resistance takeover plan can be stopped before it is put into action. 9. January 2002: Keepers of t",
