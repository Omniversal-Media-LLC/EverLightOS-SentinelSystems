Though the Aeirans could not plug the second, third and fourth DNA strands into each other until the fourth strand had been fully assembled, the identity pattern manifested itself within the second, third and fourth dimensions, creating an emotional/elemental body in D-2, a mental body in D-3 and an astral body in D-4. As the Aeiran race progressively assembled its fourth DNA strand, unity between D-2 emotional awareness, D-3 mental awareness and D-4 astral awareness would result, allowing the consciousness to separate from the physical body and travel through the D-4 astral planes. Once all of the fourth strand was assembled and the ancestral soul fragments integrated, the Seal of Palaidor would release in the Aeiran genetic code, the emotional, mental and astral identities would merge, the activation code overtones of the Fifth Cloister (the Hibiru) would plug in and release the Seal of Amenti, allowing ascension through the Blue Flame in the Sphere of Amenti to occur. The Third and Fourth Root Races did not have an astral body as their genetic imprint did not include the fourth/D-4 strand of DNA. Only mem- bers of Races three and four who participated in inter-stellar breeding were able to create the organizational form of an astral body in D-4 and splice in the imprint for the fourth DNA strand.
