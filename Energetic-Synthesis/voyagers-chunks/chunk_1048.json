It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Guardians to raise Earth's grid speed that high without the infusions of D-4 energy that were now blocked by the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence, so correction of the Sun\u2019s Merkaba Fields became a race for time within the Guardian legions. Even though the Frequency Fence did not lift until 1992, the Guardians were successful in raising the grid speed enough for the Arc of the Covenant to open by the 10/1986 deadline. The accelerated energy infusions used to re- balance the Merkaba Fields of the Sun, began in 1973 and were projected into the solar fields via beam ships stationed in the future D-4 time cycle. These infusions would cause rapid shifts of the energy fields on Earth, which would have created havoc within the consciousness of the human popula- tions and instability of Earth\u2019s natural EM fields. However, the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence allowed the Guardians to employ Holographic Insert tech- nology on Earth, through which the illusion of grid stability could be created, so the Guardian re-balancing efforts would remain undetected and excessive instability within the human populations could be avoided. Earth existed under these Guardian-created Holographic Inserts from 1973 to 1/11/1992, when the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence began lifting. THE MONTAUK PROJECT Zeta",
