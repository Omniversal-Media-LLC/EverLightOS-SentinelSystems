  "text": "Four Evolutionary Rounds, Co-Resonant Continuum ized by vibrational variance, that cross through each other at fixed points when the frequency rhythms that define each cycle reach a temporary state of vibrational co-resonance (hold the same vibration). Our present moment point emerges as one small point of vibration-oscillation rhythm within the greater rhythm of the Time Vector, Continuum and Cycle within which it is placed. When our planet enters a point in its fixed linear Time Vector at which other Time Vectors cross through our Time Vector, via temporary vibrational co-resonance, we have the power to literally shift our present Time Vector alignment into an alternate linear Time Vector with a different future \u201cevent horizon\u201d. If our present moment point exists as part of a linear Time Vector cycle in which undesirable \u201cpast\u201d events, serving as the \u201ccause\u201d, have their recipro- cal \u201ceffect\u201d manifestation in an undesirable \u201cfuture\u201d event horizon, we can change our direction from the present by changing our present vibrational rhythm. The present moment is the \u201cCause\u201d; the past (lower frequency projection) and future ( higher frequency projection) are the \u201ceffects\u201d that extend backward and forward in time ( simultaneously emerge into lower and higher frequency projection) from the frequency pattern and vibrational rhythm that defines the present moment point.
