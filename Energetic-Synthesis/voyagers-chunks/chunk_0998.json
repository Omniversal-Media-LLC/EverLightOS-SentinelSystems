The D-3 time cycle of parallel anti-particle Earth is, in reality, the same time cycle as the fourth dimension cycle in the particle universe. Thus humans possessing mid-range vibrational rates would find themselves on Earth entering the time cycle of the fourth dimension for a period of five years. Humans who have the highest vibration rates will enter hyper-space then re-appear on Earth within the next Harmonic Universe up, HU-2, which constitutes a position in time 5532.5 years in the future. Humans with the highest vibration rates will find themselves traveling through time, experientially either by portal passage or via spacecraft, to the future parallel Earth of HU-2. The future Earth and its paral- lel in HU-2 represent the planet Tara and its double, at a point in time 225 mil- lion years in the future from the time of Tara\u2019s cataclysm.\u00b9 Normally, within five years following the half-point morphogenetic wave crest, the overtone particles of Earth will have entered the HU-2 time cycles. During the morphogenetic wave 2213 years in the future, at the natu- ral close of the ascension cycle, the remaining base-tone particles of Earth would transmute in the same manner. Earth would shift completely out of HU-1 and fully enter the D-4 time cycle, the first 4,426-year cycle of",
