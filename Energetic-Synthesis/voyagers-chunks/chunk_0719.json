If the Sphere of Amenti were not removed, the Earth would explode. In order to avoid planetary destruction the Elohim of HU-3 and the Ra Confederacy entity families detached the Sphere of Amenti morphogenetic field from Earth's core in D-2, 5,500,000 years ago. It was placed in a secure position in deep space within the fourth-dimensional frequency bands. Because the Sphere was placed within the D-4 frequency bands, it acquired a fourth-dimensional frequency seal, which meant that souls who had not yet assem- bled their fourth strand of DNA could no longer merge with their Root Race mor- phogenetic \ufb01eld/soul matrix or that of their Cloister.
