Though Merlin assist- ed in the return of the Staff Star Gate tool (the \u201cSword Excalibur\u201d) to Maji Arthur\u2019s protection,''Merlin'' (Victorous) later betrayed the Emer- ald Covenant Mission in favor of the Hyksos-Knights Templar Galactic Federation World Dominion agenda. Arthur successfully returned the Staff tool to the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box and relocated the Arc Box containing the Rod and Staff from the Vale of Pewsey, England to where it remains hidden today. Arthur and his Knights were unsuccessful in disengaging the Nibiruian Diodic Crystal Grid. But at least they man- aged to hide the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box and Rod and Staff tools from Galactic Federation, their Hyksos-Knights Templar and the even- tually competing Nephedem-Drakonian Knights Malta, preventing them from fulfilling their planetary genocide and takeover agenda. The \u201cQuest for the Holy Grail\u201d and \u201cSearch for Arc of the Covenant Gold Box\u201d has continued ever since. 324",
