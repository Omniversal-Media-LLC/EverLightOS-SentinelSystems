The Eternal Gestalts of Consciousness that exist in the form of Primal Sound Fields are called Yanas (pronounced \u201cyon\u2019-us\u201d) or sometimes \u201cAscended Masters Consciousness Collectives.\u201d The Yanas Collectives are also occasionally referred to as \u201cUltra-terrestrials\u201d or at times \u201cGeomantic Entities,\u201d as they would appear as \u201cgeometric shapes made of living light\u201d when viewed from the earthly perspective.
