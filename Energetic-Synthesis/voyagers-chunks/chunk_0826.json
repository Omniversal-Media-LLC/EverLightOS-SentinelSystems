Atlantis again became a cultural center, but never again reached its previous height of development. Most of the Dracos were evacuated from Earth by their Anunnaki-Resistance accomplices, and the Templar-Annu continued to hold their ground within Atlantean and Egyptian cultures. Following the cataclysm of 52,000 years ago the Anunnaki of the Sirian Council and several other stellar neighbors returned to Earth, assisting the humans to rebuild. During the explosions beneath the ground the portal pas- sage to the Arc of the Covenant had been damaged, and the energetic grid beneath the Atlantean continent was unstable. The Elohim, Ra Confederacy and other guardian groups from HU-2 restructured the Arc of the Covenant, moving the portal that connected it to Earth out of Atlantis and into the regions of Egypt, where the Earth grid structure was more stable. The Serres- Egyptian races would now share guardianship and control of the Arc of the Covenant with the Annu-Melchizedeks and Hebrew peoples who migrated there following the explosions. The cultural hub of Earth was relocated from Atlantis to Egypt about 51,750 years ago, and Egypt began to thrive.
