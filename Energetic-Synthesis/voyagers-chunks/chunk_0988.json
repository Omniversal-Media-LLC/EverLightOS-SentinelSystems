(Photons are created through the fusion of multidimensional par- ticles and anti-particles, so the Photon Belt is the residual energy left over from the last morphogenetic wave. That energy is replenished every 26,556 years as the Holographic Beam projects through Alcyone twice during each second ascension cycle.) As Earth moves through its next 26,566-year cycle following the release of the last Holographic Beam, completing a full round of its Harmonic Time cycle, it will appear as though the Photon Belt is moving closer to Earth and its solar system. They are actually moving toward each other, as the Pleiades and the Earth\u2019s solar system travel in their orbits within the HU-1 and HU-2 Harmonic Time cycles. When Earth completes its half-point in the second 115",
