The Particle Transition process of multi-dimensional planetary evolution is very complex and utterly alien to our scientific communities, yet it is a cohesive model, consistent with the structure and mechanics of 15-dimensional physics that are introduced in Volume II, Voyagers: Secrets of Amenti. If this model accurately illustrates the hidden dynamics of planetary evolution, the seeming absence of Visitor or Elder Race evidence on Earth can be easily accounted for; the remains exist, but most of them are contained beneath the soils of parallel Earth. Remains that vanish when Earth transitions back into the particle universe, can be rediscovered when Earth once again passes into the anti-particle universe, at the completion of its 26,556-year time cycle. Within Earth\u2019s natural time cycle passage, the present cycle would end in 4230 AD, at which time various types of missing remains would become available for discovery. Due to events described in Volume II, the opportunity for some such discoveries may present itself between 2000 and 2017. This is a very brief review of the basic concepts involved with the Particle Transition theory; the mechanics involved are much more sophisticated than I have described. I don\u2019t fully understand these dynamics, but I find the theory absolutely fascinating. It is the most intelligent",
