Areas holding D-9 Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba will fully enter Trion/ Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket protection for Three-Day Particle Conversion Period. 33. 2006 June: Expedited Three-Day Particle Conversion Period and the 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble. Sometime between June and Dec 2006, Earth will encounter the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period (See page 223); fulfillment of the \"Night of the Two Moons\" prophecy. Earth will come into full alignment with the Holographic Beam/Photon Belt (originally due 2017, May 5-June 30), while protected within the Trion/Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket. If the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period is successfully postponed until 2006, GA will continue strengthening the Trion/ Meajh\u00e9 Field Buffer Blanket in attempt to pull all of Earth into D-9 Planetary Qua- tra Phase/Merkaba Vehicle hyper-dimensional suspension. In June 2006, Earth enters Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal (dimensions 1-9 of Earth Sealed to D-12 sub-frequency bands) sustained by 12-Code activation of Inner Earth Crystal Pylon Temples/Earth Cue Sites #1 through #9.
