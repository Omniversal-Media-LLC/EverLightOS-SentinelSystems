  "text": "Ascension Mechanics anti-particles, from the lowest dimensions to the highest, within the 15- dimensional scale. The progressive release of particles and anti-particles into the morpho- genetic field at the Primary Coordinate Points in the second ascension cycle constitutes the release of a particle/anti-particle wave of energy. This parti- cle/anti-particle energy wave is called a morphogenetic wave. The morpho- genetic wave represents the energy released as particles and anti-particles fuse, exploded into the morphogenetic field/hyper-space and undergo fission and replication, through which they re-appear in expanded form within the dimensional frequency fields of the next highest Harmonic Universe. At the beginning of a 4,426-year second ascension cycle, the Earth draws patterns of frequency into its morphogenetic field at Earth\u2019s D-2 core from the dimensional Unified Field of energy. When Earth approaches the half-point in the cycle, the core morphogenetic field has expanded to its full capacity of energy holding. About 15 to 20 years before the half-cycle point the Earth\u2019s energetic grid begins to interact with that of Tara, just as the Earth\u2019s core mor- phogenetic field reaches full energy-holding capacity and explodes, releasing a rush of energy through the Earth\u2019s grid. As this energy is released, the particles carrying overtone frequencies begin merging with Tara\u2019s ant",
