Once on Earth, with the help of the Sirian Council, this group of Ur-Tarranates transmuted their body forms into pure energy (Keylontic science) and merged into a gestalt energy field of consciousness, which served as a morphogenetic field or the 12-strand DNA Turaneusiam race prototype. Also contained within this morphogenetic field were the Keylontic Time Codes (electrotonal fre- quency patterns) of the pre-cataclysmic time/space coordinates of Tara, which would allow Tara to re-assemble the lost portions of its grid into the fabric of time. With the assistance of the Ra Confederacy this gestalt of con- sciousness/genetic and planetary morphogenetic field was entered into the remaining morphogenetic field of Earth through the 11th and 14th dimen- sions. This morphogenetic field of consciousness energetically took on the shape of a sphere, and was called the Sphere of Amenti , named after the por- tion of Tara\u2019s morphogenetic field that contained the imprint for Mu and its inhabitants. Amenti was the part of Tara\u2019s planetary core that connected energetically to the portals upon the continent of Mu. By placing the Sphere of Amenti within the Earth core, a \u201cworm hole\u201d or portal link was established between Earth\u2019s core in dimension two and Tara's core in dimension 5.
