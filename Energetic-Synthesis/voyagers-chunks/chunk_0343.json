This created a literal barrier in minute sound particles that kept your base DNA from picking up the contents of the \u201celectrified sound signals\u201d that were stored. This is a frequency fence. It is created by \u201cediting\u201d and \u201csplicing together\u201d specific portions of a frequency band, that serves to \u201cremove the receivers\u201d on one end of the wave pattern and \u201cquarantine\u201d the other portions of that band, whereas the new wave pattern generated through the splice \u201coverrides\u201d the original wave structure, sending portions of it \u201criding above\u201d this artificially created wave pattern. It is a form of frequency modulation, and when applied to the base tones (base sound units of the Keylonta Codes) of the human DNA effectively creates a \u201cperceptual block\u201d by altering the electrical impulse patterns and thus the chemical and hormonal operations within the biological structure. The original frequency fence employed by the Host Soul Matrices was used to allow you time to develop as a species, without disabling your physical bodies through excessive frequency input. The matter particles of which you were composed had to expand through time before they would be able to hold the amount of energy contained within the key codes. So as your intellect developed so did your physical structure. A \u201cnatural progression to enlightenme",
