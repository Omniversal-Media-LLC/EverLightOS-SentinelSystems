In a brief moment the course of intended history was changed, as the second-dimen- sional energy transmissions of the Rod interacted with the fifth-dimensional energy transmissions of the Staff to create a double overtone frequency field. When the double overtone was struck, the energetic barrier around the Sphere of Amenti collapsed, opening the D-2 Earth morphogenetic field into the Sphere of Amenti. This released the chaotic energies of the soul fragments caught in D-1 and D-2 (known as the Underworld) into the morphogenetic field of the Sphere of Amenti. The Elohim immediately intervened, descending through the Arc of the Covenant, resealing the Sphere of Amenti. Portions of the Amenti morpho- genetic field had been contaminated by the chaotic forces of D-2, and the Elohim had to separate the Sphere of Amenti, leaving the contaminated por- tions within the D-2 Earth core morphogenetic field.
