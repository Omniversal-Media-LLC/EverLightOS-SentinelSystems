  "text": "Ascension Mechanics human souls, who cannot fully assemble the fifth strand while embodied, but have assembled the fourth strand, choose to drop their physical bodies, so they may rapidly assemble D-5 frequency into their morphogenetic field from D-4. Such individuals will ascend to Tara as soul essence from D-4, so they do not have to continue incarnational cycles in HU-l. There are frequently localized disaster events during these periods through which masses of people die and leave their bodies at one time. The events may appear tragic from an earthly perspective, but from the soul perspective participation in these events is planned in order to catch the morphogenetic wave and ascend. During the five-year period prior to the half-point in the cycle, when Earth and Tara shift into the fourth-dimensional frequency bands, the part of Earth\u2019s particles that vibrate/pulsate at D-5 speed, begin to fully transmute and appear on Tara, within the time cycles of HU-2. The highest vibrating particles enter hyper-space and re-appear in the future. The portions of Earth\u2019s particles that pulsate the slowest fall further in vibration at the release of the higher pulsating particles and drop into the Unified Field of the base- tone frequency patterns of D-1. The slowest vibrating particles break apart their form construction and re-appear as part of the Earth\u2019s particle-base in the past, a",
