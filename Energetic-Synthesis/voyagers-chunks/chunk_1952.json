  "text": ", spiraling pathway of energy transit from the Meta-galactic Core at D-8 to all of the other dimensional systems. These spirals of EM energy run through various galaxies and star systems before entering into Earth\u2019s solar system. There is a natural pathway of inter- dimensional Merkaba Field alignment through which these energies interface with Earth during the second ascension cycle period. The form-holding morphogenetic imprint for the Milky Way Galaxy exists within the frequency bands of D-9, thus D-9 is considered to represent the Galactic Core. (D-8 holds the morphogenetic field for the entire 15- 470",
