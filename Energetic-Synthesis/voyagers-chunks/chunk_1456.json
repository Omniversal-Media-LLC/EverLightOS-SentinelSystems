Each Round of human race settlement was intended to progressively bring in a cycle of frequencies from the Universal Christos Template, the Shield of Aramatena. The Manifesta- tion Templates of the Earth-Tara-Gaia body cannot be fully corrected to the Christos Blueprint all at one time. Manifestation Templates are scalar-stand- ing-wave grids of interdimensional light and sound frequencies upon which the planetary molecular base builds up into manifestation. The molecular structure of the planetary body must progressively expand to hold the greater amounts of interdimensional energy that will infuse into the Plane- tary Manifestation Template through the Christos Realignment. If too much frequency is fed into the Planetary Template too rapidly, the physical struc- ture of atoms, molecules and sub-atomic particles will be unable to alter their natural vibration rhythm fast enough to keep up with Template accelera- tion. If an excessive amount of D-12 frequency from the D-12 Shield of Ara- matena Universal Christos Blueprint was brought into the Planetary Manifestation Templates of",
