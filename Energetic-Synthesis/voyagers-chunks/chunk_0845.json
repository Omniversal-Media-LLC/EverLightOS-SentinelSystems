Earth entered her new 26,556-year cycle 24,324 years ago in 22,326 BC, with the challenge of rebalancing her energetic grid following the Atlantean explosions of 28,000 BC. With the close of the old cycle came a natural period of dimensional blending through which the Sphere of Amenti could have been re-entered into the Earth core, but due to the continuing setbacks and necessity for planetary rebalancing, the Earth grid did not vibrate high enough for the Sphere of Amenti to be returned. At the onset of the new cycle in 22,326 BC, the Halls of Amenti would have to remain closed to the masses, as human evolution continued slowly along its course. The first 4,426 years within the new cycle represented a time of great promise, for this cycle period constituted the natural point at which Earth would release two morphogenetic waves, through which masses of people could ascend to Tara if the Halls of Amenti were opened.
