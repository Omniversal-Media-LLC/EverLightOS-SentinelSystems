  "text": "mpet technology utilizes specifically calibrated electromagnetic wave fields, combined at precise angles of interface, which, when ''sparked'' with a specific type of electrical charge, create a \u201cSub-space Sonic Beam\u201d that is literally shaped like a trumpet. The ''Trumpet'' Sub-Space Mion Field wave-form has a long tubelike extension emerging from its point of projection to its target. At the target site, the Trumpet wave-field expands outward into an inverted cone, like the \u201chead\u201d of a trumpet instrument. The Mion vibration rhythm of the Trumpet wave-field can be precisely calibrated to \u201cmatch\u201d the scalar-template of any matter form. Once the ''Form-lock'' is established, the vibration rhythm of the Trumpet wave-field is progressively accelerated, which causes the template of the matter-form to which it is bonded to instantaneously shatter. When the scalar-template of a wave-form shatters, the physical matter structure literally \u201cde-manifests\u201d into vapor, leaving only a trace of residual ash behind.
