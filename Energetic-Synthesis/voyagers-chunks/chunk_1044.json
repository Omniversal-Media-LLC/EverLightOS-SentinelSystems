Originally the Guardians planned to slowly accelerate the vibration rate of Earth\u2019s grid through occasional infusions of D-4 energy that would slowly bring the grid into alignment and correct the pole tilt over the course of about 2,000 years. These occasional energy transmissions began in 196 BC, when Earth entered its present 4,426-year cycle. In their original plan the Guardians intended to raise Earth\u2019s grid vibration into the UHF bands of the third dimension begin- ning in the 1950s, so the first seal on the Arc of the Covenant could be released no later than October of 1986. Following the release of the first seal on the Arc, the Sphere of Amenti would begin its 12-14 month descent into Earth\u2019s core. The Sphere of Amenti had to be in place no later than 1/1/1988 so the Sphere would be able to fulfill the first 12-year phase of its activation cycle no later than 2,000 AD. Once the Sphere was fully activated to the 3-dimen- sional level in Earth\u2019s D-2 core, it would cause Earth\u2019s grid to send a spark of D-5 frequency into the Arc of the Covenant, releasing the second seal on the Arc. This would begin the 12-year descent of the Blue Flame of Amenti and the shift of Earth from the D-3 to the D-4 time cycle. The",
