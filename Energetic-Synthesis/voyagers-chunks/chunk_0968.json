Individuals possessing these genetic codes have a per- sonal advantage in terms of ascension, if their codes are fully activated. ln order to be born into bodies with the advanced genetic lines these souls, (unless they are over-souls or avatars birthing directly from HU-3 and above), had to evolve through incarnations carrying the smaller gene-code imprint, in order to attain the frequencies within their consciousness that would allow them energetic compatibility with the larger gene-code body. In other words, humans with larger gene-code imprints have earned this privi- lege through their evolutionary progression, just as present-day souls within smaller gene-code bodies are in the process of evolving into larger gene-code bodies. All human souls are involved with the exact same process of evolving the genetic package and consciousness to higher-dimensional levels; some souls are just further along in this journey. Humans carrying the larger gene-code packages are a gift to other evolving souls, because, as they assemble their fifth and higher DNA strands, they pull higher-dimensional frequency into the Earth\u2019s grid. Once this higher-dimensional frequency reaches a certain peak concentration within the Earth\u2019s grid, the race morphogenetic field/Sphere of Am",
