It is important to note that the genetic deviations carried by these groups were not inferior or \u201cbad;\u201d the deviations simply would have taken those aspects of humanity on a different evolutionary course. This would have eventually redirected the entire course of human evolution, and the original Turaneusiam 12-strand DNA package would no longer be available to the human lineage of Earth. The 12-strand package is one of the highest genetic imprints within HU-1 and HU-2 for it allows full transmutation out of matter and can embody the consciousness of a 12-dimensional oversoul when the 12 strands are fully activated. Very few biological forms possess this potential. Humans carrying the lineage of the deviated genetic codes are in no way infe- rior to other human strains, and as long as excessive deviations are not allowed to alter the original Amenti morphogenetic field, those races do not pose a threat to the human lineage. As you will see, through the course of this chapter, the guardian races have insured the integrity of the human genetic imprint, and have also made it possible for the races deviating from that imprint to return and ascend through the Sphere of Amenti. The Hebrew morphogenetic field was realigned and entered",
