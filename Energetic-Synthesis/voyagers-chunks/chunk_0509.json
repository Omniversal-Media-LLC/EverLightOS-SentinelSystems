Now give the mental command \u201cMonitor Retrieve.\u201d Continue to visualize the blue circle surrounding the white point of light with the gold speck of light at its center, as you fall asleep. Become aware of your breathing rhythm and with each inhale begin to move the Symbol Code inward toward the center of your brain (the pineal gland specifically). With each exhale imagine the Symbol Code expanding outward to encompass your head (and body if you still find yourself being aware of the body\u2019s position). Contract the Symbol Code into your brain with each inhale and expand it outward to encompass your head and body with each exhale, synchronizing this visualization with your breathing rhythm. (This allows the subliminal Symbol Code to become programmed into the Cellular Memory.) Take 4 to 6 breaths then stop at the final inhale, positioning the symbol at the center of your brain.",
