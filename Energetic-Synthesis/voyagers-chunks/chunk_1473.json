In the realities of the Mechanics of Manifestation , the \u201cpoint of power is always in the present\u201d. Past and future Time Vectors extend out from every present moment point as a series of electromagnetic \u201crays\u201d, or inter- connected, cyclic patterns of linear progression with varying rhythms of vibrational oscillation. A Time Cycle, and its inherent Time Continua and smaller Time Vectors are all fixed, repeating cycles of frequency character- 286",
