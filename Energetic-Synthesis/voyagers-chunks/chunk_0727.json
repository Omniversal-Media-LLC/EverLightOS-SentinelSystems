  "text": "The Electric Wars Amenti could be returned to Earth's core, releasing the fourth-dimensional Seal of Palaidor and the souls lost in D-2 and D-4 could ascend. Not only did the Seal of Palaidor create problems within the incarnational process, it also created problems for the physical incarnates on Earth. The race morphogenetic field through which a race incarnates represents the living memory bank of that evolving race. If the morphogenetic field of a race is removed from a planet and its energies are no longer running through the plan- etary grid, the entire race memory is wiped out of the planet\u2019s cellular memory. People alive on the planet cannot find the content or sequence of most of the race memory. They do not remember their origins, the purposes for which they came, or their destination through the course of their evolution. The portions of the race morphogenetic field removed from the planet take with them the DNA strand imprint through which that memory would be stored within an incarnate's bodily cellular memory. Corresponding DNA particles break loose from the operating DNA strands, lose their sequence of linear order and cannot translate through the neurological structure of the human into conscious per- ception. DNA particles breaking loose from the operating strands become what Earth scientists call \u201cjunk DNA,\" stored within the cells with seemingly no purpose. Af",
