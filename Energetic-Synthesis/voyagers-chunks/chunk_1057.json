By entering the EM transmissions at the three different, but closely related time periods of 1943, 1983, and 2003, a great number of people would be affected. For the Dracos-Zeta Resistance plan to be effective, they would have to create three rips in space-time on Earth, through which their ships could be entered. One such rip already existed from the Philadelphia Experiment of 1943 and one would have to be created in 2003. The Resistance scheduled the third rip in space-time for the next Harmonic Magnetic Peak cycle of August 12th 1983, the only opportunity they would have before 2003. Working with the Interior Government, the Dracos-Zeta Resistance orches- trated another experiment, which came to be known as the Montauk Project. Again, accounts of this experiment are available in other publica- tions, so we will not detail here. The Montauk project served to widen the rip in 1983 space-time that had begun as the result of the Philadelphia Experiment. By August 14th 1983 the time periods of 1943 and 1983 were successfully linked to the Dra- cos-Zeta Resistance D-4 time period, which they used as a base of operations. From 1983 to the present, the Dracos-Zeta Resistance resumed their hybridization program through abducti",
