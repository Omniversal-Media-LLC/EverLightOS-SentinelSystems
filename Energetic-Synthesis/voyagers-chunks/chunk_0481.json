This exercise does not activate dormant DNA codes, but prepares the body to better synthesize later DNA activations, thus it is considered to be a Keylon Code Pre- activation Exercise. In using any form of hypnotic or consciousness-expansion technique it is important to first have a rudimentary understanding of the multi-dimensional mental processes involved in such manipulations of consciousness. You do not have to understand the complex workings of the brain and neurological structure to create a working comprehension of the mind and the attributes of consciousness associated with that facility. It is however useful to have a basic model of the structure of multi-dimensional identity in order to gain sovereignty over the processes associated with the multi-dimensional mind. For this reason we will provide the following model of multi-dimensional identity and a brief introduction to the Components of Mind associated with these identity levels. Using this framework you will be able to begin learning to direct multi-dimensional energy into effective transformational patterns on a conscious level. At your present stage of evolution much of these energy-directing functions take place on levels of awareness t",
