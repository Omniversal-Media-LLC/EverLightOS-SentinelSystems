The DNA Templates of the Angelic Human Races within each Evolutionary Round Cycle are built upon specific scalar-standing wave Light-Sound patterns called Fire Letter Sequences. \u2022 The Manifestation Templates of all things and systems are built upon spe- cific, fixed organizations of dimensionalized frequency bands. Each di- mensional band has 12 Fire Letters, or fixed points of consolidated frequency; each dimensional band represents 1 Fire Letter Sequence or 12 Fire Letters (12 Fire Letters per Dimension x 1 dimension of manifest- tation = 12 Fire Letters). \u2022 When Fire Letter Sequences in a Manifestation Template are in natural or- der, the frequencies in different dimensional bands can merge with each other. \u2022 The 12 Fire Letter Sequences (144 Fire Letters) inherent to the 12-Strand DNA Template of each Angelic Human Race in each Evolutionary Round correspond to the 12 Fire Letter Sequences that compose Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields . The DNA Templates of each Race in each Evolution- ary Round holds a specific portion of the Fire Letter Sequences corre- sponding to Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields. \u2022 As an Angelic Human Race Round evolves on Earth, the correct Fire Letter Sequences of the Universal Christos Divine Blueprint, the D-12 Shield of Aramatena (Earth\u2019s D-12 Pre-matter Liquid-Light Template)",
