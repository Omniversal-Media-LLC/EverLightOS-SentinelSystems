The new release of the Holographic Beam creates the morphogenetic wave that allows portions of Earth and Tara to temporarily merge within the fourth dimension. The infu- sion of Earth\u2019s grid with D-5 through D-9 frequency occurs through the Holo- graphic Beam. When that energy infusion begins, five years prior to the half- point, Earth begins passing into the Holographic Beam as it merges with Tara and enters the D-4 time cycle. As this occurs, Earth\u2019s overtone particles move into the Photon Belt. While particles and anti-particles reverse polarity and spin, and the angular rotation of particles shifts 45\u00b0, the morphogenetic fields of D-2 Earth\u2019s core and D-5 Tara\u2019s core come into direct alignment with the Holographic Beam. The beam allows the D-2 and D-5 planetary core mor- phogenetic fields to open into each other, which creates an infusion of D-5 frequency into Earth\u2019s grid. At the height of the morphogenetic wave crest, at the half-point in the cycle, the Holographic Beam is aligned directly through the planetary cores of Earth, Tara and Gaia for about three days, and the grids of Earth and Tara are in complete alignment. The Holographic Beam runs from the D-8 Meta- Galactic Core, upward into the D-9 Galactic Core, then downw",
