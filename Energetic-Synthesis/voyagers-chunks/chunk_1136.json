Such a planet will continue to evolve within its Har- monic Universe time cycles, slowly expending the energies held within its core, until its particle pulsation rhythms slow, its temperatures cool and even- tually it implodes to become a black hole. It can take billions of years for a Descending Planet to meet this destination, this does not occur quickly, and life can continue to evolve upon its surface for many years. In the case of Earth\u2019s coming changes, when the planet is shifted to the Bridge Zone, the portions of Earth\u2019s particles that do not make the shift will become a Phan- tom Earth\u2014a Descending Earth. The phantom version of Earth will be cut off from the interdimensional Time Matrix grid, and the Phantom Earth will return to the D-3 time cycle following 2017. The entire Bridge Zone Project was designed to keep Earth\u2019s primary particle base out of that D-3 time cycle, because in that time contin- uum the Dracos-Zeta Resistance successfully employs the Frequency Fence and creates Earth\u2019s destruction in 2976 AD. (This probable future for the D-3 time cycle can be averted if the Resistance-inspired 2003 experiment does not take place.) In the Phantom Earth D-3 time cycle Earth changes occur, which debilitate a portion of human civilization, and th",
