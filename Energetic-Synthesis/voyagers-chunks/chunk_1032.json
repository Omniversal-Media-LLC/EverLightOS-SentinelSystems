We will not detail the experiment here, as there are several published accounts of this event, but we would like you to understand the Zetas\u2019 motivation for instigating this project. The Zetas knew that in creating such an experiment, which utilized the creation of an external, manufactured Merkaba Field, that the functions of Earth\u2019s natural Merkaba Fields would be disrupted. They failed to share this knowledge with the US. government. The experiment created a \u201crip in space-time,\u201d or a tear in the natural Merkaba Fields, which served as a dimen- sional warp through which the Zetas could secretly pass their ships to Earth from their D-4 future location. Using this rip in space-time, the Zetas were able to transport large numbers of their spacecraft, undetected by human observation, into Earth\u2019s D-2 Merkaba Field, and, from there, the ships could be used to broadcast specific electromagnetic pulses directly into Earth\u2019s D-1 Merkaba Field at the center of the Sun. Because the Earth is directly connected to Sun through the Stellar Spirals of the multidimensional Merkaba Fields, the Zetas knew they could misalign the grids of Earth and Tara by manipulating the Merkaba Fields of the Sun. They desired to create a Fre",
