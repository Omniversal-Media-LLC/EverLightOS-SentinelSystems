  "text": "Ascension Cycle Dynamics the operation of the Seed Crystal Seals. The Seed Crystal Seals of the human body are located at the center of the 15 primary chakra centers, nine of which are located within the physical body structure. Of the nine embodied chakras, two are presently dormant; these will be called into activation in humans participating in Stellar Activations. The six remaining chakras exist within the bio-energetic field, some close to the body, others extending outward into the galaxy. The six disembodied chakras connect the human bio-energetic system and dimensional Merkaba Fields to the Merkaba Fields of Earth and the Stellar Spirals. The disembodied higher chakra centers will also be called into activation during Stellar Activations. The human bio-energetic field also contains 15 Star Crystal Seals which con- trol the function of the Seed Crystal Seals and the angle of rotation of the personal Dimensional and Harmonic Merkaba Fields. Six of the Star Crystal Seals are located outside of the body, nine are stationed within the body at various levels of dimensional frequency. The Star Crystal Seals of the human body are presently in a dormant state, which keeps the Seed Crystal Seals of the chakra system closed, the body\u2019s particle base and consciousness separated and the personal Dimen- sional Merkaba Fields locked into their respective dimensional frequency bands.
