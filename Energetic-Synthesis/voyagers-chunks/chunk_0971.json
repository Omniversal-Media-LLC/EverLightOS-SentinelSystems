  "text": "Ascension Mechanics Amenti is not within the Earth\u2019s core, its frequencies cannot be opened into the Earth\u2019s grid, and thus the bio-energetic fields of the races will not receive an infusion of fifth-dimensional frequency. It is the infusion of fifth-dimen- sional frequency that allows the imprint for the fifth DNA strand to manifest within all races. Thus in order for the races to have the opportunity for accel- eration of evolution, Earth must be able to sustain a concentration of souls with higher frequency gene codes and be able to hold the Sphere of Amenti at its core. The Earth grid must be in balance for this evolutionary accelera- tion of the races to occur. EARTH TIME CYCLES Morphogenetic Waves There are only certain points within each 26,556-year cycle of time that the Earth grid reaches a vibration rate high enough to accommodate an infusion of fifth-dimensional energy. It is during these times that Earth can sustain larger concentrations of higher-frequency souls, and thus it is only during these periods that the Sphere of Amenti can be fully opened within the Earth core, to allow assembly of the fifth DNA strand for all of the races. There are other periods, such as during the time of Pharaoh Akhenaton, when the Sphere can be returned to Earth core and the Halls of Amenti opened. But the full frequency patterns of the Sphere of Amenti can be trans- mitted through E",
