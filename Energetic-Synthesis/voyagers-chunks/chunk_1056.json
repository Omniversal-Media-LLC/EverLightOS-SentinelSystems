Harmonic Magnetic Peaks occur when base tone\u2014 base tone, overtone\u2014 overtone, or resonant tone\u2014resonant tone Merkaba Field alignments take place. The D-1 base tone Merkaba Field of Earth and the D-4 base tone Merkaba Field of Tara reach their Magnetic Peak cycle once every 20 years between August 12th-15th, at which time a dimensional window opens between Earth\u2019s HU-1, and Tara\u2019s HU-2, time continuum cycles. The first Harmonic Magnetic Peak of the 20th century occurred on August 12th, 1903, and the last on August 12th, 1983. These periods mark a time of peak magnetic pull within Earth\u2019s subtle energy bodies and height- ened dimensional blending, through which large numbers of Dracos-Zeta ships could be cloaked and brought to Earth from D-4. August 12th, 2003 is the closest peak date to the Dracos-Zeta Resistance target date of 2004. The plan called for a simultaneous entry of beam ships during three time periods, and once the Zetas had successfully orchestrated infiltration, they would broadcast their Frequency Fence through Earth\u2019s grid and begin the genetic mutation. If they attempted this mutation from only one time period, there would not be enough time for it to take hold within the majority of the popu- lations. By entering the EM transmissions at the three different, but closely related time periods o",
