The D-5 Pleiadian Activation becomes available to the masses (those who were not born with the fifth DNA strand imprint) on 9/9/2004, with the birth of Avatar 4 and the release of the corrected fifth DNA strand imprint through Earth\u2019s grid. At this time fifth strand assembly can begin for those who completed fourth strand assembly and Heart Star Activation through the Solar Activation. The masses will not be able to complete the D-5 Pleiadian Activation until the 5/5/2012, following the birth of Avatar 6 and the activation of the fifth-strand codes. 209",
