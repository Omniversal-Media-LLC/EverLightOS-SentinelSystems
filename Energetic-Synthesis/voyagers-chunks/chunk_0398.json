Biologically you are accelerating in evolution as you are assimilating greater amounts of the Keylonta Codes within your cellular structure. You are becoming more aware and knowledgeable than your contemporaries who rely upon the logical facilities and emotional repression alone. You have more power, more awareness and more responsibility toward the conscious evolution of your species. And your first responsibility is to be healing yourselves through clearing the emotional energies and allowing the energy of the soul matrix to flow into your biological form. Then you will be prepared to help others of your kind approach the subconscious forces that move them. Through the intuitives will come many healing therapies aimed at clearing the emotional imprint, many ideas and practices that may seem foreign to the logical/intellectual minds of those who are still directed by the subconscious forces. Before you scoff at these \u201cillogical\u201d modalities, take inventory of how little you really know about the nature of your identity, the workings of your body and the purpose for your existence. Before you discredit the practices that will allow your logical mind to grow, find humility, and realize that you have much to learn.",
