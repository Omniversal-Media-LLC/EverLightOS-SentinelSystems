The Partiki Grid serves as a \u201ccollector\u201d of Par- tiki units, pulling in new Partiki. As Partiki units build up within the Partiki grid, they begin to form more complex structures of elec- tro-tonal impulse that become imbedded in the grid as crystalline Keylon configurations, or Keylon Codes. The Keylon codes set and hold the structure for all manifestations of matter, pre-matter, anti-mat- ter and energy fields. Partiki Grids create the Unified Field of Energy and Consciousness, within which all things in the dimensionalized universe reside and Keylon Codes create individuation of form and consciousness within the Unified Field. Keylon Codes direct the patterns of Partiki fission/ fusion and the patterns of refraction and replication of electro-tonal energy that allow for differentiation of form and consciousness within the unified Partiki grid of the Cosmic Matrix. 459",
