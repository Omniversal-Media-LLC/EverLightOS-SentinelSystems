The problem of \u201cghost\u201d impressions or fragmented bits of original cellular memory required some framework of explanation to the developing intellect of the species. Some groups handled this problem by making these impressions \u201coff limits\u201d to the human, teaching that these images and impressions were \u201cbad \u201cor \u201cevil\u201d and must be avoided. The intellectual facilities of the digressed human species at that time was not ready to understand concepts of genetics, thus they were not ready to comprehend the truth of their origins. By leading them away from the old memory imprints and into a focus upon the new program that the Hosts were trying to instill, the humans were allowed to develop a clear linear focus of identity in time, so as to become functional within linear, present-moment reality, while developing a sense of consistent linear progression of identity through time. At that time exploring the \u201cghost\u201d images that were surfacing from the dismantled DNA would have created such bleed-through from the old Soul Matrix that development of intellect would have been impossible. So in the early teachings things were put simply. Gods, \u201cdemons\u201d (the ghost images emerging from cellular memory), laws and punishments. Portions of the truth",
