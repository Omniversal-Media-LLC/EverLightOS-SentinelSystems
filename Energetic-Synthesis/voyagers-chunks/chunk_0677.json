With this sphere placed within the Earth as Earth re- evolved through dimensional ascension back into the Tara grid following the morphogenetic imprint from the sphere, a link between the future Tara and its pre-cataclysmic past would be reestablished. Tara's past would be re- attached to the Time Matrix grid and Tara's future time cycles. Through the Sphere of Amenti a bridge was constructed between Tara's pre-cataclysmic past and future tracks/cycles of time. When a planet undergoes such a trauma, having a portion of its grid blown apart, not only does it lose the portions of its evolutionary history stored within the cellular memory of the parts that blew apart, it also loses a portion of its energetic thrust. Without this thrust the planet cannot evolve out of its Har- monic Universe and into the next. The planet, and most life forms on it, become trapped in the fabric of time. The Sphere of Amenti not only gave hope for the continued evolution of human/Turaneusiam lineage, it held the hopes of ascension and continued evolution for Earth, Tara and their seventh- dimensional counterpart Gaia. lf one was trapped in time, they would all be trapped. The only other option available in such cases of planetary morphoge- netic field fragmentation is that of a Ho",
