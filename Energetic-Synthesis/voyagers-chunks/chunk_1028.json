All dimensions exist in the same space, but seem to operate separately due to the particle pulsation rates of which they are composed. Particle pulsation rates are created by the degrees of angular rotation at which particles and anti- particles spin in relation to each other. In one universe there are 15 primary dimensional bands. Dimensional frequency bands group in sets of 3, and each set of three dimensions represents a Harmonic Universe. Thus there are five Harmonic Universes within one 15-dimensional Universe. The degree of angu- lar rotation of particle spin shifts 90\u00b0 from one dimension to the next within one Harmonic Universe. In each Harmonic Universe containing three dimen- 129",
