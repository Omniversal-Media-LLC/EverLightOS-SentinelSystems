In some cases such environmentally forced redirection of our mental and emotional focus from fixation on past events and issues represents a potential healing catharsis within the collective psyche, as individuals and nations begin to reassess and redirect their priorities. But in other cases, distraction from pertinent past concerns can prevent us from acquiring the very answers we seek concerning the contemporary drama. ''UFO INVESTIGATION\u201d AND \u201cTRIGGER EVENTS'' One of the most important multifaceted issues that might readily and \u201cconveniently\u201d succumb to further malnutrition of mass attention is the highly complex issue of ''UFO investigation. '' The \u201cUFO issue\u201d is, in truth, a compendium of a variety of interrelated subjects: \u201cUFO sightings\u201d; crop circles; ET visitation/abduction; the \u201cUFO Movement\u201d; the \u201cNew Age movement\u201d; \u201cangelic\u201d contact; \u201cchanneling\u201d communication; \u201cspiritual development\u201d; \u201cascension teachings\u201d; \u201cofficial denial\u201d; \u201cIlluminati One- World-Order agendas\u201d; \u201cforbidden archeology\u201d; and the multitudes of related, politically charged, ''conspiracy theories'' one must inevitably address if thorough investigation of the \u201cUFO issue\u201d is to be ascertained. In our present drama, seemingly born of very \u201c3-D international political issues,\u201d it is more important than ever to keep questions of the \u201cUFO issue\u201d firmly and foremost in mind.
