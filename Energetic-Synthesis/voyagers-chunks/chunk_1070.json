  "text": "from HU-1, HU-2 and HU-3 joined together to create the Bridge Zone Project. The basic idea behind the Bridge Zone project involved shifting Earth com- pletely out of the HU-1 time cycle, an event that would not occur naturally until the second morphogenetic wave of the second ascension cycle, during the natural Doreadeshi in 4230 AD. Since the Guardians could not move the Dracos-Zeta Resistance out of the way of Earth\u2019 s intended evolution, they would instead move Earth out of the way of the Dracos-Zeta Resistance. The Guardians would construct an arti\ufb01cial time continuum between the third and fourth dimen- sions, into which Earth could pass in 2017. This constituted orchestrating a forced Doreadeshi, 2213 years ahead of its natural schedule. In order for the Dracos-Zeta Resistance\u2019s Frequency Fence to work in 2003-2004 AD, they had to transmit very specific EM pulses, at very specific angles through the Earth\u2019s grid. The Zetas had worked since 1943 to deci- pher the appropriate calculations to use for the projections of their EM pulses. If the Merkaba Fields of Earth were rapidly accelerated, which would constitute a planetary leap in time cycles from the HU-1/D-3 cycle to Bridge Zone D-3.5 cycle of the lnner Earth, between D-3 and D-4, the Zetas-Dracos calculations would be useless. The Earth\u2019s grid speed would be increased to a level that the Frequency Fence EM pulses could",
