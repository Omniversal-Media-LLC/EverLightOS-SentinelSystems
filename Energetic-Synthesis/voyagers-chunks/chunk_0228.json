Their biologies emerged 560 million years ago (YA) from combining various species of animal-like life forms indigenous to Tara during those times with other, more advanced genetic strains from other planetary and other dimensional systems. Tara was viewed as a \u201cnursery\u201d of sorts, where this new human hybrid could develop and gain sovereignty over the life forms upon the Tara. The human prototype was intended to become the custodian and guardian of Tara, and to enjoy open intergalactic and interdimensional exchange with many other civilizations. For a period of time this development occurred and the new species (humans) evolved graciously. There came a point in time however in which the species began a path of de-evolution. The humans (Turaneusiam) began interbreeding with the other indigenous life forms. Their genetic strain became more and more animal-like, which progressively reduced their ability to carry the higher intelligence for which they were intended. The species digressed, falling into more and more behaviors characteristic of the less developed life forms. Some of the humans left Tara and joined with their interstellar brothers.
