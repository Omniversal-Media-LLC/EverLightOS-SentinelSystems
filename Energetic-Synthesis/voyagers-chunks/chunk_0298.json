  "text": "nsually illusional reality could be sustained in such a way, and the humans involved would have no idea or memory indicating that anything was out of order. As the individual becomes disconnected from its original soul matrix all memory contained within its DNA and cellular pattern is wiped away, as it is the Soul Matrix that acts as the programming device and storage house for human memory. When the human is fully connected to the false matrix, the original connection to the soul can then be disengaged, and the new matrix will program the DNA and \u201cdownload\u201d the \u201cmemories\u201d purposely programmed into the false matrix. At this point in the process there would be a brief lapse of all memory, and a minor disability in short term memory functions, while the cellular code begins to process its new set of instructions. There may be trace memories from the \u201coriginal soul program\u201d that arise to awareness in \u201cghost image\u201d form, which will occasionally create severe mental disturbances for the human subject. Pieces of memory from the old program may emerge spontaneously from cellular residue and interface with the operational \u201cinstructions\u201d from the new program, distorting the electrical impulse patterns to the brain, as well as the chemical balances of the human biology.",
