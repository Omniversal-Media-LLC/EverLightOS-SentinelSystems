Each of the 12 Turaneusiam sub- races carried a genetic slant derived from the 12 primary contributors to the T-1 experiment, but all of them carried the unique l2-strand DNA package the T-1\u2019s were designed to embody. The 12 Turaneusiam sub-races were the Bra- ha-man, Dhr-ah-men, Atoni, Trin-i-ten, Azurtan, Celtos, Addami, Yut- arans, Luri, Cerrasz, Nezack-tai, and the Melchizedakz. After evolving suc- cesfully for many years the Turaneusiam race began to digress, their genetic code breaking down and their cultures falling into disharmony. Manipulation by and inter-breeding with various unrelated ET strains was the primary cause of this digression. About eight million years into their evolution (552,000,000 YA) the Turaneusiam race divided into two primary racial strains, the Alanians (sometimes referred to as the Beli-Kudyem ) and the Lumians (frequently called the Adami-Kudmon). The two strains of Turaneusiam evolved together on one large land-mass called E-Den, creating two cultures known as Alania and Lumia. Both cultures evolved on Tara for about one million years (551,000,000 YA). Both races carried the original 12-strand DNA genetic code of their Turaneusiam lineage, and both carried mutations and digressions of that code from inter-stellar breeding. Cultural disturbances escalated along with the continued digres",
