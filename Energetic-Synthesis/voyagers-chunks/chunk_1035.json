After the rip in space-time was made on August 12th, 1943, the Zetas secretly positioned their spacecraft beneath Earth\u2019s surface in the D-2 fre- quency bands and began beaming electromagnetic pulses into the Sun. Using these EM pulses, the following effects were created: The spin of the base tone particles/magnetic field of the Sun\u2019s D-1 Merk- aba Field was reversed, which made the Sun\u2019s D-1 magnetic spiral become electrical. This change in the Sun created a reciprocal shift of polarity within the D-1 Merkaba Field of Earth. Earth\u2019s D-1 base tone particles/magnetic spi- ral became electrical. This, in turn, caused Earth\u2019s D-1 electrical/overtone particle spiral to reverse and become magnetic. Through spacecraft posi- tioned within the D-4 frequency bands, the Zeta next reversed the spin on the Sun\u2019s D-4 Merkaba Field, which set the pattern for Tara's grid through the gold core crystal at the center of the Sun. The D-4 Merkaba Fields of par- ticle and anti-particle Tara were reversed. These actions constituted a full reversal of Earth\u2019s D-1 electromagnetic Merkaba Fields, and a partial reversal of Tara\u2019s D-4 electromagnetic Merkaba Fields, putting both out of alignment with the Merkaba Fields of D-2, D-3, D-5 and D-6. Normally, when the grids of Tara and Earth",
