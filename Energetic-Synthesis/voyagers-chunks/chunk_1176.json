Between 1998 and 2012, these two groups of people will progressively become more \u201cinvisible\u201d to each other, as the procession of their lives moves in opposite directions. There will appear to be natural sequences of events that occur as individuals of lower accretion begin to move out of the lives of those of higher accretion levels, to be replaced by new individuals who have a higher accretion level. Those of lower accretion levels will find themselves more and more in like company. The progressive separation of populations will take place as the particles which compose the bodies and consciousness of people with higher accre- tion/DNA strand assembly levels begin to pulsate at progressively faster rhythms, moving people of higher and lower accretion levels farther and far- ther out of each others perceptual range. During the coming transitions, par- ticle fields are separating. The bodies and consciousness of people are made of particles, thus humanity will also experience separation of its peoples into those with faster and slower-particle pulsation rhythms. All humans will experience Earth\u2019s temporary shift into the D-4 time cycle and the Stellar Activations that create this shift. Humans with lower accretion levels will have difficulty assimilating the frequencies of the Stellar Activations. The Stellar Activations will create t",
