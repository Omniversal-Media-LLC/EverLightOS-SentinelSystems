They also work with those from other dimensional systems. The Aethien are not organic to your three-dimensional frequency band, nor are they from parallel or adjacent Earths. Rather they originate from galaxies existing within the dimensions of adjacent Earths, which places them in our interdimensional/extraterrestrial category. Aethien work with humans and other sentient life forms both in your dimension and in others, and throughout the Time Portal Systems in those dimensions. They represent a species superior to that of the Zeta, and come as emissaries of peace and growth toward brotherhood for all species.",
