  "text": "Three Tracks of Time place, including the vanishings, as Holographic Inserts will be used to block perception of these events. Only the Earth changes would be apparent to the D-3 populations. Descending Planet populations will remain in the D-3 time continuum and the opportunity for mass ascension will no longer be possible in the future. Ascension of individuals will have to be orchestrated through Host Matrix Transplants. If the Frequency Fence becomes operational in 2004, they will see Earth changes and will be under covert Dracos-Zeta Resis- tance mind control. If not, they will slowly evolve and reincarnate toward building the fourth and fifth DNA strands through Host Matrix assistance. 2. Group Two \u2014 Bridge Zone Perceptual Station The populations who shift into the Bridge Zone will experience more obvious phenomena of change as the two particle bases of Earth complete their 2017 separation. Many structures of inorganic substance, composed of lower-vibrating particles, will simply appear to vanish, as well as populations having lower accretion levels. New island land masses will have appeared to emerge out of the oceans, seemingly over night. New passageways into the Earth will be found that lead into the Inner Earth territories. The most amaz- ing phenomenon to manifest in the Bridge Zone will be the sudden appear- ance of buildings, roads and other structures of civiliza",
