As the currents of frequency moving through the ALL system progressively reverse to the unnatural ARPS of the Phantom Matrix, the corresponding portions of Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields are drawn into electromagnetic bonding with the D-7 Phantom Arcturus Planetary Shields. The first three Jehovian Seals reverse the ARPS on the three ALL networks to which they correspond. The related areas of Earth's Planetary Shields do not begin ripping apart to bond with the Phantom Matrix until the opening of the Fourth Jehovian Seal\u2014the ''Pale Horseman.'' Once a SAC has commenced, as the current SAC did on January 1, 2000, Guardian nations cannot stop or prevent the natural Organic Seal, or corresponding unnatural Jehovian Seven-Seal release sequences from occurring. Manual interruption of these processes would cause absolute, rapid pole shift and cataclysmic Earth Changes, which Guardian nations can only prevent by striving to balance the frequencies of the Organic Seals , while clearing and realigning the chaotic frequencies of the Jehovian Seals to a natural \u201c12-Code-Pulse .\u201d The Organic and Jehovian Seal counterpart must activate before 12-Code realignment can be achieved. Manual resetting of the natural 12-Code-Pulse \u201cDivine D-12 Pre-matter Blueprint\u201d in Earth\u2019s ALL system is accomplished through running D-12 frequency\u00b9 into Earth\u2019s Planetary Shields via RRTs conducted at speci",
