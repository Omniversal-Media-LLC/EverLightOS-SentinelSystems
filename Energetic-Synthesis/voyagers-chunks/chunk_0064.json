Interaction with the GA became my secret life that I was not permitted to speak of during my usual human interactions. The Guardians explained to me that, due to present human ignorance about the presence of Visitors from elsewhere, I would be persecuted and misunderstood should I try to share my knowledge of the GA. Until I was of an adult age I was to remain silent about my contact to protect myself from the interference of a well-meaning but ill-informed psychiatric community that was not in the least bit prepared to handle cases of Visitor involvement effectively. I understood the warnings of the GA and knew that if I began speaking about my experiences I would be mislabeled and diagnosed as having psychological problems, because our culture does not yet possess the knowledge through which these experiences can be rationally understood. I was consciously aware of my contact experiences throughout childhood and into adulthood, I have never been placed under hypnosis to retrieve memories of these events. My childhood memories of contact events still remain quite clear.",
