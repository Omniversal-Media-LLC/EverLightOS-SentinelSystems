The Chriastic Founders Races could incarnate into genetically restored race lines, to rehabilitate the Fallen Angelics\u2019 historically warring mentality and redirect their exploitative control-dominion agendas back into peaceful co-evolution through the Emerald Covenant, which is precisely what the Fallen Angelic race founders do not want to do. During the formation of the GA Signet Councils 570 million years ago, the MC Eieyani Master Council of Density-5 incarnated into the Azurite race line of Sirius B. Following the creation of the Oraphim Angelic Human lineage 568 million years ago, the Sirius B Azurites further combined their genetic imprint with certain lines of the new Oraphim Angelic Human lineage, creating the specialized Azurite- Oraphim Blue Angelic Human hybrid Maharaji race of Density-2 Sirius B. Both the Sirius B Azurites and Maharaji races are often referred to as the \u201cSirian Blues.\u201d The Maharaji Azurite-Humans were imbued with additional genetic coding that would allow them to biologically interface directly with the energetic templates of Star Gates 1 through 6 in the Universal Templar Complex.
