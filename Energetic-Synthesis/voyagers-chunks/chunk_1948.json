In bodies that are unprepared to receive the increase in particle pulsation rhythms brought on by the Earth\u2019s Stellar Activations, the Stellar Wave infu- sions will create a mounting sense of mental, emotional and biological fatigue. During Earth\u2019s activations, the energetic systems of humans are placed under a progressively increasing amount of electromagnetic stress at a sub-atomic level. This stress will manifest itself in a variety of ways within the human organism. Physical \u201csparking\u201d of increased static electricity, (which can occasionally affect the function of electrical and magnetic appa- ratus) may develop in some individuals, until the auric body balances the new frequencies within the body systems. For most people the infusions will not produce such pronounced symp- toms, but will rather manifest as progressively less subtle symptoms of degen- eration, lessening of vitality and physical deterioration. The Stellar Activations and Infusions progressively cause more noticeable physical symp- toms, which begin subtly and progressively intensify. Through learning",
