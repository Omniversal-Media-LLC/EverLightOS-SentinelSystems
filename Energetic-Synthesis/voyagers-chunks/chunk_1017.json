The covert human Majestic 12 (MJ-12) group was formed within the Allied human governments at this time, to secretly oversee treaties they formalized with the Zetas. The Zetas then began the next phase of their plan, a scheme of which MJ-12 knew nothing. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Zetas began their hybridiza- tion program, then turned their attention toward reconstruction of the Fre- quency Fence and stopping the grid merge of Earth and Tara scheduled for 2012-2017. The Zetas possess the knowledge and technology that would allow them to misalign the electromagnetic fields of Earth and Tara, so the planetary grids could not begin to merge in 2012. They understand the elec- tromagnetic relationships between Earth\u2019s planetary energetic fields and those of the Sun. With this understanding, they devised a plan to shift the electromagnetic fields of Earth and Tara by altering the electromagnetic fields of Earth\u2019s Sun. Before exploring the Zetas\u2019 manipulation of the Sun, let us review a brief lesson in the mechanics of multidimensional, electromagnetic fields. MERKABA FIELDS Merkaba Field Mechanics A",
