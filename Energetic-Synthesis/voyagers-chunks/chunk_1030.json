The Zetas determined that in order to retain control of the human soci- ety within the future space-time coordinates where they had successfully achieved dominion over Tara-Earth\u2019s territories in the D-4 time cycle, they had to stop the fifth DNA strand from manifesting within the human popula- tions of present-day Earth. Re-alignment of the fourth DNA strand by Guardian groups had broken down their D-4 Frequency Fence and they were losing control of their human subjects in the future. If the fifth DNA strand activated within 8% of Earth\u2019s present human populations, the race Morpho- genetic Field in the Sphere of Amenti would realign the Frequency Fence distortions in the grids of Earth and Tara, and the Zetas\u2019 Frequency Fence and Zeta Collective Mind Complex in D-4 would be destroyed. The upcoming morphogenetic wave period of 2012-2017 in Earth's present time cycle would allow all Earth humans to begin assembly of their fifth DNA strand and the D-4/strand-four Zeta Seal would be released in all humans. After 2017 the Zetas would totally lose control of the future human populations, if they did not stop the fifth DNA strand from activating within Earth humans and stop the present Earth grid from receiving its scheduled infusion of fifth to ninth- dimensional frequencies.
