The Induction Technique is to be done from a waking state of consciousness, not in association with sleep. Following the completion of the exercise it is useful to relax for 10-15 minutes and if you fall asleep during this period it will not detract from the effectiveness of the exercise. Things You Will Need A. The Keylonta Symbol Code Placement Chart. B. Four Keylontic Symbol Codes, pre-selected from the Keylontic Symbol Code Placement Chart. C. A small bottle of fragrant \u201cessence oil\u201d, such as the kind used in Aroma-Therapy. If you do not have essence oil you may use any type of baby oil or body lotion, but we recommend essence oil as the fragrance is concentrated and more easily affects the mind and body on subliminal levels. D. A private, quiet setting in which you can comfortably recline undisturbed for 20-30 minutes. Subdued lighting is recommended but not required. A soothing musical \u201crelaxation type\u201d recording with a slow tempo and no words can assist if outside noise is a problem, but natural silence is preferable whenever possible.",
