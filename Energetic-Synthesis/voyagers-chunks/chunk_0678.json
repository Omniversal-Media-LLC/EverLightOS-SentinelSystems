The only other option available in such cases of planetary morphoge- netic field fragmentation is that of a Host Matrix Transplant (as previously dis- cussed in relation to people), and this is exceedingly difficult to achieve on a planetary level. Each of the 12 planets in HU-1 that emerged as a result of Tara's fragmentation received a similar morphogenetic sphere from the Palaidorians to fulfill the same purpose. But here we are only concerned with the Sphere of Amenti, as through it Earth became an ascension planet, able to achieve dimensional ascension through re-evolution. The Sphere of Amenti and Soul Ascension Rescue Mission from Tara 550,000,000\u2014250,000,000 YA The Sphere of Amenti was entered into Earth's core within the second- dimensional frequency bands (often called the \u201cCave of Creation\u201d) about 550 million years ago from a position in HU-2 space/time that existed before the Earth existed within that HU-2 time track. The rescue mission for Tara's lost souls was begun before those souls became lost, in terms of linear time. Such things are quite practical within the structure of the Time Matrix. Through the Covenant of Palaidor and the Sphere of Amenti the souls of Earth could re-evolve back into their original 12-strand DNA bod",
